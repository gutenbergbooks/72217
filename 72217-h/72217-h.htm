</div>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">J</span>OSEPH MOXON was born at Wakefield in
Yorkshire, England, August 8, 1627. There
is no published record of his parentage or his
early education. His first business was that of a
maker and vender of mathematical instruments, in
which industry he earned a memorable reputation
between the years 1659 and 1683. He was not
content with this work, for he had leanings to other
branches of the mechanic arts, and especially toward
the designing of letters and the making of
printing-types.</p>

<p>In 1669 he published a sheet in folio under the
heading of “Prooves of the Several Sorts of Letters
Cast by Joseph Moxon.” The imprint is “Westminster,
Printed by Joseph Moxon, in Russell
street, at the Sign of the Atlas, 1669.” This specimen
of types seems to have been printed, not to
show his dexterity as a type-founder, but to advertise
himself as a dealer in mathematical and scientific

<span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span>

instruments. The reading matter of the sheet
describes “Globes Celestial and Terrestrial, Large
Maps of the World, A Tutor to Astronomie and to
Geographie”—all of his own production. Reed
flouts the typography of this sheet: “It is a sorry
performance. Only one fount, the Pica, has any
pretensions to elegance or regularity. The others
are so clumsily cut or badly cast, and so wretchedly
printed, as here and there to be almost undecipherable.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The rude workmanship of these early
types proves, as he afterward admitted, that he had
never been properly taught the art of type-founding;
that he had learned it, as he said others had,
“of his own genuine inclination.”</p>

<p>It was then a difficult task to learn any valuable
trade. The Star Chamber decree of 1637 ordained
that there should be but four type-founders for the
kingdom of Great Britain, and the number of their
apprentices was restricted. When the Long Parliament
met in 1640, the decrees of the Star Chamber
were practically dead letters, and for a few years
there was free trade in typography. In 1644 the
Star Chamber regulations were reimposed; in 1662
they were made more rigorous than ever. The importation
of types from abroad without the consent
of the Stationers’ Company was prohibited. British

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xi]</span>

printers were compelled to buy the inferior types of
English founders, who, secure in their monopoly, did
but little for the improvement of printing.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that the attention of Moxon was
first drawn to type-founding by the founders themselves,
who had to employ mechanics of skill for
the making of their molds and other implements of
type-casting. In this manner he could have obtained
an insight into the mysteries of the art that
had been carefully concealed. He did not learn
type-making or printing in the usual routine. The
records of the Company of Stationers do not show
that he was ever made a freeman of that guild, yet
he openly carried on the two distinct businesses of
type-founding and printing after 1669. It is probable
that he had a special permit from a higher
authority, for in 1665 he had been appointed hydrographer
to the king, and a good salary was given
with the office. He was then devoted to the practical
side of scientific pursuits, and was deferred to
as a man of ability.</p>

<p>He published several mathematical treatises between
the years 1658 and 1687; one, called “Compendium
Euclidis Curiosi,” was translated by him

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xii]</span>

from Dutch into English, and printed in London in 1677. Mores
supposes that he had acquired a knowledge of Dutch by residence in
Holland, but intimates that he was not proficient in its grammar.<a
id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In 1676 he published a book on the shapes of
letters, with this formidable title: “Regulæ Trium
Ordinum Literarum Typographicarum; or the Rules
of the Three Orders of Print Letters, viz: the Roman,
Italick, English—Capitals and Small; showing
how they are Compounded of Geometrick Figures,
and mostly made by Rule and Compass.
Useful for Writing Masters, Painters, Carvers, Masons
and others that are Lovers of Curiosity. By
Joseph Moxon, Hydrographer to the King’s Most
Excellent Majesty. Printed for Joseph Moxon on
Ludgate Hill, at the Sign of Atlas, 1676.” He then
dedicated the book to Sir Christopher Wren, “as a
lover of rule and proportion,” or to one who might
be pleased with this attempt to make alphabetical
letters conform to geometric rules.</p>

<p>There is no intimation that the book was intended
for punch-cutters. It contains specific directions
about the shapes of letters, covering fifty-two pages,
as proper introduction to the thirty-eight pages of
model letters that follow, rudely drawn and printed
from copper plates. Moxon says that these model

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xiii]</span>

letters are his copies of the letters of Christopher Van Dijk, the
famous punch-cutter of Holland. He advises that each letter should be
plotted upon a framework of small squares—forty-two squares in height
and of a proportionate width, as is distinctly shown in the plates
of letters in this book.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Upon these squares the draftsman should draw
circles, angles, and straight lines, as are fully set forth in the
instructions.</p>

<p>These diagrams, with their accompanying instruction,
have afforded much amusement to type-founders.
All of them unite in saying that the forming of letters
by geometrical rule is absurd and impracticable.
This proposition must be conceded without debate,
but the general disparagement of all the letters, in
which even Reed joins, may be safely controverted.
It is admitted that the characters are rudely drawn,
and many have faults of disproportion; but it must
not be forgotten that they were designed to meet
the most important requirement of a reader—to be
read, and read easily. Here are the broad hair-line,
the stubby serif on the lower-case and the bracketed
serif on the capitals, the thick stem, the strong
and low crown on letters like m and n, with other
peculiarities now commended in old-style faces and
often erroneously regarded as the original devices
of the first Caslon. The black-letter has more merit

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xiv]</span>

than the roman or italic. Some of the capitals are
really uncouth; but with all their faults the general
effect of a composition in these letters will be found
more satisfactory to the bibliophile as a text-type
than any form of pointed black that has been devised
in this century as an improvement.</p>

<p>Moxon confesses no obligation to any one for his
geometrical system, but earlier writers had propounded
a similar theory. Books on the true proportions
of letters had been written by Fra Luca
Paccioli, Venice, 1509; Albert Dürer, Nuremberg,
1525; Geofroy Tory, Paris, 1529; and Yciar, Saragossa,
1548. Nor did the attempt to make letters
conform to geometrical rules end with Moxon. In
1694, M. Jaugeon, chief of the commission appointed
by the Academy of Sciences of Paris, formulated
a system that required a plot of 2304 little
squares for the accurate construction of every full-bodied
capital letter. The manuscript and diagrams
of the author were never put in print, but
are still preserved in the papers of the Academy.</p>

<p>This essay on the forms of letters seems to have
been sent out as the forerunner of a larger work on
the theory and practice of mechanical arts. Under
the general title of “Mechanick Exercises,” in 1677,
he began the publication, in fourteen monthly numbers,
of treatises on the trades of the smith, the
joiner, the carpenter, and the turner. These constitute
the first volume of the “Mechanick Exercises.”

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xv]</span>

The book did not find as many buyers as had been
expected. Moxon attributed its slow sale to political
excitement, for the Oates plot put the buying and
study of trade books away from the minds of readers.
He had to wait until 1683 before he began
the publication of the second volume, which consists
of twenty-four numbers, and treats of the art
of printing only. It is this second volume that is
here reprinted, for the first volume is of slight interest
to the printer or man of letters.</p>

<p>Moxon’s book has the distinction of being not
only the first, but the most complete of the few
early manuals of typography. Fournier’s “Manuel
Typographique” of 1764 is the only book that can
be compared with it in minuteness of detail concerning
type-making, but he treats of type-making
only. Reed says: “Any one acquainted with the
modern practice of punch-cutting cannot but be
struck, on reading the directions laid down in the
‘Mechanick Exercises,’ with the slightness of the
changes which the manual processes of that art
have undergone during the last two centuries. Indeed,
allowing for improvements in tools, and the
greater variety of gauges, we might almost assert
that the punch-cutter of Moxon’s day knew scarcely
less than the punch-cutter of our day, with the accumulated
experience of two hundred years, could
teach him.... For almost a century it remained
the only authority on the subject; subsequently it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xvi]</span>

formed the basis of numerous other treatises both at home and
abroad; and to this day it is quoted and referred to, not only by
the antiquary, who desires to learn what the art once was, but by
the practical printer, who may still on many subjects gather from
it much advice and information as to what it should still be.”<a
id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>During his business life, Moxon stood at the head of the trade in
England. He was selected to cut a font of type for an edition of the
New Testament in the Irish language, which font was afterward used for
many other books. He cut also the characters designed by Bishop John
Wilkins for his “Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical
Language,” and many mathematical and astronomical symbols. Rowe Mores,
who describes him as an excellent artist and an admirable mechanic,
says that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1678.<a
id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
There is no known record of the date of his death. Mores gives the year
1683 as the date of his relinquishment of the business of type-making,
but he was active as a writer and a publisher for some years after.</p>

<p>The first volume of the “Mechanick Exercises,”
concerning carpentry, etc., went to its third edition
in 1703, but the second volume, about printing, has
been neglected for two centuries. During this long

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xvii]</span>

interval many copies of the first small edition of five hundred copies
have been destroyed. A perfect copy is rare, and commands a high price,
for no early book on technical printing is in greater request.<a
id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The instruction directly given is of value, but bits
of information indirectly furnished are of greater
interest. From no other book can one glean so
many evidences of the poverty of the old printing-house.
Its scant supply of types, its shackly hand-presses,
its mean printing-inks, its paper-windows
and awkward methods, when not specifically confessed,
are plainly indicated. The high standard of
proof-reading here exacted may be profitably contrasted
with its sorry performance upon the following
pages. The garments worn by the workmen
are shown in the illustrations. Some of the quainter
usages of the trade are told in the “Customs of the
Chappel,” and those of the masters, in the ceremonies
of the Stationers’ Company, and in the festivals in
which masters and workmen joined. To the student
of printing a reading of the book is really necessary
for a clear understanding of the mechanical side of
the art as practised in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg xviii‐xix]</span></p>

<br>
<p class="center large">NOTE BY THE PRINTER</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This edition of the “Mechanick Exercises” is a line-for-line and
page-for-page reprint of the original text. The only suppression
is that of the repetition of the words “Volume II” in the running
title and the sub-titles, which would unnecessarily mislead the
reader, and of the old signature marks that would confuse the
bookbinder. Typographic peculiarities have been followed, even
to the copying of gross faults, like doublets, that will be readily
corrected by the reader. The object of the reprint is not merely
to present the thought of the author, but to illustrate the typographic
style of his time with its usual defects. A few deviations
from copy that seemed to be needed for a clearer understanding
of the meaning of the author have been specified at
the end of the second volume. The irregular spelling and punctuation
of the copy, its capricious use of capitals and italic, its
headings of different sizes of type, have been repeated. At this
point imitation has stopped. Turned and broken letters, wrong font
characters, broken space-lines, and bent rules have not been
servilely reproduced. These blemishes, as well as the frequent
“monks” and “friars” in the presswork, were serious enough to
prevent an attempt at a photographic facsimile of the pages.</p>

<p>The two copies of Moxon that have served as “copy” for this
reprint show occasional differences in spelling and punctuation.
Changes, possibly made in the correction of batters, or after the
tardy discovery of faults, must have been done while the form was
on press and partly printed. The position of the plates differs
seriously in the two copies; they do not follow each other in the
numerical order specified. In this reprint the plates that describe
types and tools have been placed near their verbal descriptions.</p>

<p>The type selected for this work was cast from matrices struck
with the punches (made about 1740) of the first Caslon. It is of
the same large English body as that of the original, but a trifle
smaller as to face, and not as compressed as the type used by
Moxon; but it repeats many of his peculiarities, and fairly
reproduces the more important mannerisms of the printing of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The portraits have been reproduced by the artotype process of
Bierstadt; the descriptive illustrations are from the etched plates
of the Hagopian Photo-Engraving Company.</p>

Hansard says (“Typographia,” p. vii): “I have never been able to
meet with more than two copies of this work—one in the Library of the
British Museum—the other in the Library of the Society of Arts.” The
writer knows of but three copies in America: one in the Library Company
of Philadelphia; one in the Library of the Typothetæ of New-York; one
in his own collection.</p>

with</i> Typographie, <i>I shall say somewhat of its Original
Invention; I mean here in</i> Europe, <i>not of theirs in</i> China
<i>and other Eastern Countries, who (by general assent) have had it for
many hundreds of years, though their Invention is very different from
ours; they Cutting their Letters upon Blocks in whole Pages or Forms,
as among us our Wooden Pictures are Cut; But</i> Printing <i>with
single Letters Cast in Mettal, as with us here in</i> Europe, <i>is an
Invention scarce above Two hundred and fifteen years old; and yet an
undecidable Controversie about the original Contriver or Contrivers
remains on foot,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>

between the</i> Harlemers <i>of</i> Holland, <i>and those of</i> Mentz
<i>in</i> Germany: <i>But because the difference cannot be determin’d
for want of undeniable Authority, I shall only deliver both their Pleas
to this</i> Scientifick Invention.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Harlemers <i>plead that</i> Lawrensz Jansz Koster of
Harlem <i>was the first Inventer of</i> Printing, <i>in the year of our
Lord</i> 1430. <i>but that in the Infancy of this Invention he used
only Wooden Blocks</i> (<i>as in</i> China, <i>&amp;c. aforesaid</i>)
<i>but after some time he left off Wood, and Cut single Letters in
Steel, which he sunck into Copper</i> Matrices, <i>and fitting them
to Iron Molds, Cast single Letters of Mettal in those</i> Matrices.
<i>They say also, that his Companion</i>, John Gutenberg, <i>stole his
Tools away while he was at Church, and with them went to</i> Mentz
<i>in</i> Germany, <i>and there set his Tools to work, and promoted
His claim to the first Invention of this Art, before</i> Koster <i>did
His</i>.</p>

<p><i>To prove this, they say that</i> Rabbi Joseph (<i>a Jew</i>)
<i>in his Chronicle, mentions a Printed Book that he saw in</i> Venice,
<i>in the year</i> 5188. <i>according to the Jewish Account, and by
ours the year</i> 1428. <i>as may be read in</i> Pet. Scriverius.</p>

<p><i>They say much of a Book intituled</i> De Spiegel, <i>Printed
at</i> Harlem <i>in</i> Dutch <i>and</i> Latin; <i>which Book is yet
there to be seen: and they alledge that Book the first that ever was
Printed: But yet say not when this Book was Printed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Notwithstanding this Plea, I do not find</i> (<i>perhaps because
of their imperfect Proofs</i>) <i>but that</i> Gutenberg <i>of</i>
Mentz <i>is more generally accepted for the first Inventer of</i>
Printing, <i>than</i> Koster <i>of</i> Harlem.</p>

<p><i>The Learned Dr.</i> Wallis <i>of</i> Oxford, <i>hath made an
Inquiry into the original of this Invention, and hath in brief sum’d up
the matter in these words</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>About the year of our Lord 1460. The Art of <i>Printing</i> began
to be invented and practised in <i>Germany</i>, whether first at
<i>Mentz</i> or first at <i>Harlem</i> it is not agreed: But it seems
that those who had it in consideration before it was brought to
perfection, disagreeing among themselves, did part Company; and some of
them at <i>Harlem</i>, others at <i>Mentz</i> persued the design at the
same time.</p>

<p><i>The Book which is commonly reputed to have been first Printed
is</i>, Tullies Offices, <i>of which there be Copies extant (as a
Rarity) in many Libraries; which in the close of it is said to be
Printed at</i> Mentz, <i>in the year of our Lord</i> 1465. (<i>so says
that Copy in the</i> Bodleyan <i>Library</i>) <i>or</i> 1466. (<i>so
that in the Library of</i> Corpus Christi.) <i>The words in the close
of that in</i> Corpus Christi <i>Colledge</i> Oxon <i>are these</i>,</p>

<p>Præsens <i>Marcij Tullij</i> Clarissimum opus, <i>Johanes Hust,
Moguntinus</i> Civis, non Atrimento, plumali canna, neq; ærea, sed Arte

Mensis <i>Februarij</i>.</p>

<p><i>The like in the</i> Bodleyan <i>Library; save there the
Date is only thus</i>, Finitum Anno M CCCC LX V. <i>In the same
Book there are these written Notes subjoyned</i>: Hic eft ille
<i>Johannes Faustus</i>, coadjutor <i>Johannes Gutenbergij</i>

<p><i>At</i> Harlem <i>and some other places in</i> Holland, <i>they
pretend to have Books Printed somewhat ancienter than this; but
they are most of them</i> (<i>if not all</i>) <i>done by way of
Carving whole Pages in Wood, not by single Letters Cast in Mettal,
to be Composed and Distributed as occasion serves, as is now the
manner.</i></p>

<p><i>The chief Inventer at</i> Harlem <i>is said to be</i> Laurens
Jansz Koster.</p>

<p><i>After these two places</i> (Mentz <i>and</i> Harlem) <i>it
seems next of all to have been practised at</i> Oxford: <i>For by
the care, and at the charge of King</i> Henry <i>the</i> 6<i>th, and
of</i> Thomas Bourchier <i>then Arch-Bishop of</i> Canterbury (<i>and
Chancellour of the University of</i> Oxford) Robert Turner <i>Master of
the Robe, and</i> William Caxton <i>a Merchant of</i> London <i>were
for that purpose sent to</i> Harlem, <i>at the charges partly of the
King, partly of the Arch-Bishop, who then</i> (<i>because these of</i>
Harlem <i>were very chary of this secret</i>) <i>prevailed privately
with one</i> Frederick Corseles <i>an under-Workman, for a sum of
Money, to come over hither; who thereupon did at</i> Oxford <i>set
up the Art of</i> Printing, <i>before it was exercised any where
else in</i> England, <i>or in</i> France, Italy, Venice, Germany,
<i>or any other place, except only</i> Mentz <i>and</i> Harlem
(<i>aforementioned</i>): <i>And there be several Copies yet extant (as
one in the Archives of the University of</i> Oxford, <i>another in the
Library of Dr.</i> Tho. Barlow, <i>now Bishop of</i> Lincoln) <i>of a
Treatise

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>

of St.</i> Jerome (<i>as it is there called</i> (<i>because found among
St.</i> Jerom’s <i>Works</i>) <i>or rather </i> Ruffinus <i>upon
the Creed, in a broad</i> Octavo) <i>Printed at</i> Oxford <i>in the
year</i> 1468. <i>as appears by the words in the close of it</i>.</p>

<p>Explicit expositio Sancti <i>Jeronimi</i> in sembolo Apostolorum ad
papam Laurentium Impressi <i>Oxonie</i> &amp; finita Anno Domini M CCCC
LX VIII. xvij die <i>Decembris</i>.</p>

<p><i>Which is but three years later than that of</i> Tullies Offices
<i>at</i> Mentz, <i>in</i> 1465. <i>and was perhaps one of the
first Books Printed on Paper</i>; (<i>that of</i> Tully <i>being
on Vellom</i>.) <i>And there the excercise of</i> Printing <i>hath
continued successively to this day.</i></p>

<p><i>Soon after</i> William Caxton (<i>the same I suppose who first
brought it to</i> Oxford) <i>promoted it to</i> London <i>also,
which</i> Baker <i>in his Chronicle</i> (<i>and some others</i>)
<i>say to have been about the year</i> 1471. <i>but we have scarce any
Copies of Books there Printed remaining</i> (<i>that I have seen</i>)
<i>earlier than the year</i> 1480. <i>And by that time, or soon after,
it began to be received in</i> Venice, Italy, Germany, <i>and other
places, as appears by Books yet extant, Printed at divers places in
those Times. Thus far Dr.</i> Wallis.</p>

<p><i>But whoever were the Inventers of this Art, or</i> (<i>as some
Authors will have it</i>) <i>Science; nay, Science of Sciences</i>
(<i>say they</i>) <i>certain it is, that in all its Branches it can be
deemed little less than a Science: And I hope I say not to much of</i>
Typographie: <i>For Dr.</i> Dee, <i>in his Mathematical Preface to</i>
Euclids Elements of Geometrie, <i>hath worthily taken pains to make</i>
Architecture <i>a Mathematical Science; and as a vertual Proof of his
own Learned Plea, quotes two Authentique Authors,</i> viz.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>

Vitruvius <i>and</i> Leo Baptista, <i>who both give their descriptions
and applause of</i> Architecture: <i>His Arguments are somewhat
copious, and the Original easily procurable in the English Tongue;
therefore instead of transcribing it, I shall refer my Reader to the
Text it self.</i></p>

<p><i>Upon the consideration of what he has said in behalf of</i>
Architecture, <i>I find that a</i> Typographer <i>ought to be equally
qualified with all the Sciences that becomes an</i> Architect, <i>and
then I think no doubt remains that</i> Typographie <i>is not also a
Mathematical Science</i>.</p>

<p><i>For my own part, I weighed it well in my thoughts, and find all
the accomplishments, and some more of an</i> Architect <i>necessary
in a</i> Typographer: <i>and though my business be not Argumentation,
yet my Reader, by perusing the following discourse, may perhaps
satisfie himself, that a</i> Typographer <i>ought to be a man of
Sciences</i>.</p>

<p><i>By a</i> Typographer, <i>I do not mean a</i> Printer, <i>as he is
Vulgarly accounted, any more than Dr.</i> Dee <i>means a</i> Carpenter
<i>or</i> Mason <i>to be an</i> Architect: <i>But by a</i> Typographer,
<i>I mean such a one, who by his own Judgement, from solid reasoning
with himself, can either perform, or direct others to perform from
the beginning to the end, all the Handy-works and Physical Operations
relating to</i> Typographie.</p>

<p><i>Such a</i> Scientifick <i>man was doubtless he who was the first
Inventer of</i> Typographie; <i>but I think few have succeeded him in
Science, though the number of</i> Founders <i>and</i> Printers <i>be
grown very many: Insomuch that for the more easie managing of</i>
Typographie, <i>the Operators have found it necessary to devide it into
several Trades, each of which (in the strictest sence) stand no

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>

nearer related to</i> Typographie, <i>than</i> Carpentry <i>or</i>
Masonry, <i>&amp;c. are to</i> Architecture. <i>The several devisions
that are made, are</i>,</p>

<p>First <i>The</i> Master-Printer, <i>who is as the Soul of</i>
Printing; <i>and all the Work-men as members of the Body governed by
that Soul subserveient to him; for the</i> Letter-Cutter <i>would
Cut no Letters, the</i> Founder <i>not sinck the</i> Matrices, <i>or
Cast and Dress the Letters, the</i> Smith <i>and</i> Joyner <i>not
make the</i> Press <i>and other Utensils for</i> Printing, <i>the</i>
Compositer <i>not Compose the Letters, the</i> Correcter <i>not read
Proves, the</i> Press-man <i>not work the Forms off at the</i> Press,
<i>or the</i> Inck-maker <i>make</i> Inck <i>to work them with, but by
Orders from the</i> Master-Printer.</p>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">The</span> continuation of
my setting forth <i>Mechanick Exercises</i> having been obstructed
by the breaking out of the Plot, which took off the minds of my few
Customers from buying them, as formerly; And being of late much
importun’d by many worthy Persons to continue them; I have promised
to go on again, upon Condition, That a competent number of them may
be taken off my hand by Subscribers, soon after the publication of
them in the <i>Gazet</i>, or posting up Titles, or by the <i>Mercurius
Librarius</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Therefore such Gentlemen or others as are willing to promote the
coming forth of these <i>Exercises</i>, are desired to Subscribe their
Names and place of abode: That so such Persons as live about this City
may have them sent so soon as they come forth: Quick Sale being the
best encouragement.</p>

<p>Some Gentlemen (to whom they are very acceptable) tell me they will
take them when all <i>Trades</i> are finish’t, which cannot reasonably
be expected from me (my Years considered) in my life-time; which
implies they will be Customers when I’me dead, or perhaps by that time
some of themselves.</p>

<p>The price of these Books will be 2<i>d.</i> for each Printed Sheet.
And 2<i>d.</i> for every Print taken off of Copper Cuts.</p>

<p>There are three reasons why this price cannot be thought dear.</p>

<p class="p2-indent">1. The Writing is all new matter, not Collected,
or Translated from any other Authors: and the drafts of the Cuts all
drawn from the Tools and Machines used in each respective Trade.</p>

<p class="p2-indent">2. I Print but 500 on each Sheet, And those upon
good Paper: which makes the charge of Printing dear, proportionable to
great numbers.</p>

<p class="p2-indent">3. Some Trades are particularly affected by some
Customers, (who desire not the rest,) and consequently sooner sold off,
which renders the remainder of the un-sold <i>Exercises</i> unperfect,
and therefore not acceptable to such as desire all: so that they will
remain as waste-Paper on my hands.</p>

<h3>§. 2. <i>Of the Office of a Master</i>-Printer.</h3>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">I</span> Shall begin with the
Office of a <i>Master-Printer</i>, because (as aforesaid) he is the
Directer of all the Work-men, he is the Base (as the <i>Dutchmen</i>
properly call him) on which the Workmen stand, both for providing
Materials to Work withal, and successive variety of Directions how and
in what manner and order to perform that Work.</p>

<p>His Office is therefore to provide a House, or
Room or Rooms in which he is to set his <i>Printing-House</i>.
This expression may seem strange, but it is
<i>Printers</i> Language: For a <i>Printing-House</i> may admit
of a twofold meaning; one the Vulgar acceptance,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>

and is relative to the House or Place wherein <i>Printing</i>
is used; the other a more peculiar Phrase <i>Printers</i>
use among themselves, <i>viz.</i> only the <i>Printing</i> Tools,
which they frequently call a <i>Printing-House</i>: Thus
they say, Such a One has set up a <i>Printing-House</i>,
when as thereby they mean he has furnish’d a House
with <i>Printing</i> Tools. Or such a one has remov’d his
<i>Printing-House</i>, when thereby they only mean he
has remov’d the Tools us’d in his former House.
These expressions have been used Time out of mind,
and are continued by them to this day.</p>

<p>But to proceed, Having consider’d what number
of <i>Presses</i> and <i>Cases</i> he shall use, he makes it his business
to furnish himself with a Room or Rooms well-lighted,
and of convenient capacity for his number
of <i>Presses</i> and <i>Cases</i>, allowing for each <i>Press</i> about
Seven Foot square upon the Floor, and for every
<i>Frame</i> of <i>Cases</i> which holds Two pair of <i>Cases</i>, <i>viz.</i>
one pair <i>Romain</i> and one pair <i>Itallica</i>, Five Foot and
an half in length (for so much they contain) and
Four Foot and an half in breadth, though they contain
but Two Foot and Nine Inches: But then room
will be left to pass freely between two <i>Frames</i>.</p>

<p>We will suppose he resolves to have his <i>Presses</i> and
<i>Cases</i> stand in the same Room (though in <i>England</i> it
is not very customary). He places the <i>Cases</i> on that
side the Room where they will most conveniently
stand, so, as when the <i>Compositer</i> is at work the Light
may come in on his Left-hand; for else his Right-hand
plying between the Window-light and his Eye might
shadow the <i>Letter</i> he would pick up: And the <i>Presses</i>
he places so, as the Light may fall from a Window

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>

right before the <i>Form</i> and <i>Tinpan</i>: And if scituation
will allow it, on the North-side the Room, that
the <i>Press-men</i>, when at their hard labour in <i>Summer</i>
time, may be the less uncommoded with the heat of
the <i>Sun</i>: And also that they may the better see by the
constancy of that Light, to keep the whole <i>Heap</i> of
an equal Colour.</p>

<p>He is also to take care that his <i>Presses</i> have a solid
and firm Foundation, and an even Horizontal Floor
to stand on, That when the <i>Presses</i> are set up their
Feet shall need no Underlays, which both damage a
<i>Press</i>, are often apt to work out, and consequently
subject it to an unstable and loose position, as shall
further be shewn when we come to the Setting up of
the <i>Press</i>.</p>

<p>And as the Foundation ought to be very firm, so
ought also the Roof and Sides of the <i>Press Room</i> to
be, that the <i>Press</i> may be fastned with Braces overhead
and on its Sides, as well and steddy as under
foot.</p>

<p>He is also to take care that the Room have a clear,
free and pretty lofty Light, not impeded with the
shadow of other Houses, or with Trees; nor so low
that the Sky-light will not reach into every part of
the Room: But yet not too high, lest the violence of
<i>Winter</i> (<i>Printers</i> using generally but Paper-windows)
gain too great advantage of Freesing the Paper and
Letter, and so both Work and Workman stand still.
Therefore he ought to Philosophize with himself, for
the making the height of his Lights to bear a rational
proportion to the capacity of the Room.</p>

<p>Here being but two sides of the Room yet used,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>

he places the <i>Correcting-stone</i> against a good Light, and
as near as he can towards the middle of the Room,
that the <i>Compositers</i> belonging to each end of the
Room may enjoy an equal access to it. But sometimes
there are several <i>Correcting-stones</i> plac’d in several
parts of the Room.</p>

<p>The <i>Lye-Trough</i> and <i>Rincing-Trough</i> he places towards
some corner of the Room, yet so as they may
have a good Light; and under these he causes a <i>Sink</i>
to be made to convey the Water out of the Room: But
if he have other conveniencies for the placing these
Troughs, he will rather set them out of the Room
to avoid the slabbering they cause in.</p>

<p>About the middle of the Room he places the <i>Destributing-Frame</i>
(<i>viz.</i> the <i>Frame</i> on which the <i>Forms</i>
are set that are to be <i>Destributed</i>) which may stand
light enough, though it stand at some considerable
distance from the Window.</p>

<p>In some other empty place of the Room (least
frequented) he causes so many <i>Nest-Frames</i> to be
made as he thinks convenient to hold the <i>Cases</i> that
may lye out of present use; and the <i>Letter-boards</i> with
<i>Forms</i> set by on them, that both the <i>Cases</i> and the
<i>Forms</i> may be the better secured from running to
<i>Pye</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus contrived the several Offices of the
Room, He furnishes it with <i>Letters</i>, <i>Presses</i>, <i>Cases</i>,
<i>Chases</i>, <i>Furniture</i>, &amp;c. Of each of which in Order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of</i> Letter.</h4>

<p>He provides a <i>Fount</i> (properly a <i>Fund</i>) of <i>Letter</i>
of all Bodies; for most <i>Printing-Houses</i> have all except
the two first, <i>viz.</i> <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Nomparel</i>, <i>Brevier</i>, <i>Long-Primmer</i>,
<i>Pica</i>, <i>English</i>, <i>Great-Primmer</i>, <i>Double-Pica</i>,
<i>Two-Lin’d-English</i>, <i>Great-Cannon</i>.</p>

<p>These are the <i>Bodies</i> most of use in <i>England</i>; But
the <i>Dutch</i> have several other <i>Bodies</i>: which because
there is little and almost no perceivable difference
from some of these mentioned, I think they are not
worth naming. Yet we have one <i>Body</i> more which
is sometimes used in <i>England</i>; that is a <i>Small Pica</i>, but
I account it no great discretion in a <i>Master-Printer</i> to
provide it; because it differs so little from the <i>Pica</i>,
that unless the Workmen be carefuller than they
sometimes are, it may be mingled with the <i>Pica</i>, and
so the Beauty of both <i>Founts</i> may be spoil’d.</p>

<p>These aforesaid <i>Bodies</i> are commonly <i>Cast</i> with a
<i>Romain</i>, <i>Italica</i>, and sometimes an <i>English Face</i>. He
also provides some <i>Bodies</i> with the <i>Musick</i>, the <i>Greek</i>,
the <i>Hebrew</i>, and the <i>Syriack Face</i>: But these, or some
of these, as he reckons his oppertunities may be to
use them.</p>

<p>And that the Reader may the better understand
the sizes of these several <i>Bodies</i>, I shall give him this
Table following; wherein is set down the number
of each <i>Body</i> that is contained in one Foot.</p>

<p>His care in the choice of these <i>Letters</i> are,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That the <i>Letter</i> have a true shape: Which
he may know, as by the §. of <i>Letter-Cutting</i>.</p>

<p>I confess this piece of Judgement, <i>viz.</i> knowing
of true Shape, may admit of some controversy, because
neither the Ancients whom we received the
knowledge of these <i>Letters</i> from, nor any other authentick
Authority have delivered us Rules, either to
make or know true shape by: And therefore it may
be objected that every one that makes <i>Letters</i> but
tolerably like <i>Romain</i>, <i>Italick</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> may pretend his
to be true shap’d.</p>

<p>To this I answer, that though we can plead no
Ancient Authority for the shape of <i>Letters</i>, yet
doubtless (if we judge rationally) we must conclude
that the <i>Romain Letters</i> were Originally invented and
contrived to be made and consist of Circles, Arches
of Circles, and straight Lines; and therefore those
<i>Letters</i> that have these Figures, either entire, or else
properly mixt, so as the Course and Progress of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>

Pen may best admit, may deserve the name of true
Shape, rather than those that have not.</p>

<p>Besides, Since the late made <i>Dutch-Letters</i> are so generally,
and indeed most deservedly accounted the
best, as for their Shape, consisting so exactly of Mathematical
Regular Figures as aforesaid, And for the
commodious Fatness they have beyond other <i>Letters</i>,
which easing the Eyes in Reading, renders them
more Legible; As also the true placing their Fats
and their Leans, with the sweet driving them into
one another, and indeed all the accomplishments
that can render <i>Letter</i> regular and beautiful, do
more visibly appear in them than in any <i>Letters</i>
Cut by any other People: And therefore I think
we may account the Rules they were made by, to
be the Rules of true shap’d <i>Letters</i>.</p>

<p>For my own part, I liked their <i>Letters</i> so well, especially
those that were Cut by <i>Christophel Van Dijck</i>
of <i>Amsterdam</i>, that I set my self to examine the
Proportions of all and every the parts and Members
of every <i>Letter</i>, and was so well pleased with the
Harmony and Decorum of their Symetrie, and
found so much Regularity in every part, and so good
reason for his Order and Method, that I examined
the biggest of his <i>Letters</i> with Glasses, which so
magnified the whole <i>Letter</i>, that I could easily distinguish,
and with small Deviders measure off the
size, scituation and form of every part, and the proportion
every part bore to the whole; and for my
own future satisfaction collected my Observations into
a Book, which I have inserted in my <i>Exercises</i>
on <i>Letter-Cutting</i>. For therein I have exhibited to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>

the World the true Shape of <i>Christophel Van Dijcks</i>
aforesaid <i>Letters</i>, largely Engraven in Copper Plates.</p>

<p>Whence I conclude, That since common consent
of Book-men assign the Garland to the <i>Dutch-Letters</i>
as of late <i>Cut</i>, and that now those <i>Letters</i> are reduced
unto a Rule, I think the Objection is Answered;
And our <i>Master-Printers</i> care in the choice of good
and true shap’d <i>Letters</i> is no difficult Task: For if
it be a large Bodied <i>Letter</i>, as <i>English</i>, <i>Great-Primmer</i>
and upwards, it will shew it self; and if it be small,
as <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Nomparel</i>, &amp;c. though it may be difficult
to judge the exact Symetry with the naked Eye, yet
by the help of a <i>Magnifying-Glass</i> or two if occasion
be, even those small <i>Letters</i> will appear as large as
the biggest Bodied <i>Letters</i> shall to the naked Eye:
And then it will be no difficult Task to judge of the
Order and Decorum even of the smallest Bodied <i>Letters</i>.
For indeed, to my wonder and astonishment,
I have observ’d <i>V. Dijcks Pearl Dutch Letters</i> in Glasses
that have Magnified them to great <i>Letters</i>, and
found the whole Shape bear such true proportion to
his great <i>Letters</i>, both for the <i>Thickness</i>, <i>Shape</i>, <i>Fats</i>
and <i>Leans</i>, as if with Compasses he could have measur’d
and set off in that small compass every particular
Member, and the true breadth of every <i>Fat</i> and
<i>Lean Stroak</i> in each <i>Letter</i>, not to exceed or want
(when magnified) of <i>Letter Cut</i> to the <i>Body</i> it was
Magnified to.</p>

<p>His second care in the choice of <i>Letters</i> is, That
they be deep <i>Cut</i>; for then they will <i>Print</i> clear the
longer, and be less subject to entertain <i>Picks</i>.</p>

<p>His third care, That they be deep sunck in the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>

<i>Matrices</i> least the bottom line of a <i>Page</i> Beard. Yet
though they be deep sunk, His care ought to be
to see the Beard also well cut off by the <i>Founder</i>.</p>

<p>And a Fourth Care in the choice of <i>Letter</i> is,
That his <i>Letter</i> be Cast upon good Mettal, that it
may last the longer.</p>

<p>Of each Body he provides a <i>Fount</i> suitable to
such sorts of Work as he designs to do; But he
provides not an equal weight of every <i>Fount</i>; Because
all these Bodies are not in equal use: For the
<i>Long-Primmer</i>, <i>Pica</i> and <i>English</i> are the Bodies that
are generally most used; And therefore he provides
very large <i>Founts</i> of these, <i>viz.</i> of the <i>Long-Primmer</i>
in a small <i>Printing-House</i>, Five hundred
Pounds weight <i>Romain</i> and <i>Italica</i>, whereof One
hundred and fifty Pounds may be <i>Italica</i>. Of the
<i>Pica</i> and <i>English</i>, <i>Roman</i> and <i>Italica</i>, Eight, Nine
hundred, or a Thousand Pounds weight: when as
of other <i>Founts</i> Three or Four hundred Pounds
weight is accounted a good <i>Fount</i>: And of the <i>Cannon</i>
and <i>Great-Cannon</i>, One hundred Pounds or
somewhat less may serve his turn; Because the common
use of them is to set Titles with.</p>

<p>Besides <i>Letters</i> he Provides Characters of Astronomical
Signs, <i>Planets</i>, <i>Aspects</i>, <i>Algebraical</i> Characters,
Physical and Chimical Characters, <i>&amp;c.</i> And these of
several of the most used Bodies.</p>

<p>He Provides also <i>Flowers</i> to set over the Head of
a <i>Page</i> at the beginning of a Book: But they are
now accounted old-fashion, and therefore much out
of use. Yet <i>Wooden-Borders</i>, if well Drawn, and neatly
Cut, may be <i>Printed</i> in a Creditable Book, As
also,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>

<i>Wooden-Letters</i> well Drawn and neatly Cut may be
used at the beginning of a <i>Dedication</i>, <i>Preface</i>, <i>Section</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Yet instead of <i>Wooden Letters</i>, <i>Capitals</i> Cast
in Mettal generally now serves; because but few or
good <i>Cutters</i> in <i>Wood</i> appear.</p>

<p>He also provides <i>Brass-Rules</i> of about Sixteen
Inches long, that the <i>Compositer</i> may cut them into
such Lengths as his Work requires.</p>

<p>In the choice of his <i>Brass-Rules</i>, he examines that
they be exactly <i>Letter high</i>; for if they be much too
high, they may cut through <i>Paper</i>, <i>Tinpan</i> and <i>Blankets</i>
too; And if they be but a little too high, not
only the Sholder, or Beard, on either side them will
<i>Print</i> black; but they will bear the <i>Plattin</i> off the
<i>Letters</i> that stand near them, so that those <i>Letters</i> will
not <i>Print</i> at all: And if they be too low, then the
<i>Rules</i> themselves will not <i>Print</i>.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens through the unskilfulness of
the <i>Joyner</i>, (for they commonly, but unproperly, imploy
<i>Joyners</i> to make them) that a Length shall be
hollow in the middle both on the Face and Foot,
and shall run driving higher and higher towards both
ends: Hence it comes to pass, that when the <i>Compositer</i>
cuts a piece of <i>Rule</i> to his intended Length,
the <i>Rule</i> shall <i>Print</i> hard at one end, and the other
shall not <i>Print</i> at all; So that he shall be forced to
knock up the foot of the low end, as shall be shewn
in its proper place.</p>

<p>But the careful <i>Master-Printer</i> having found that
his <i>Brass-Rules</i> is <i>Letter</i> high all the whole Length,
will also examine whether it be straight all the
whole Length, which he does by applying both the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>

Face and Foot to the surface of the <i>Correcting-stone</i>;
And if the Face and Foot comply so closely with the
<i>Correcting-stone</i>, that light cannot be seen between
them, he concludes the <i>Brass-Rule</i> is straight.</p>

<br>
<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p018b.png" width="600" height="402" alt="Image: Plate 1.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 1.</i></span>
</div>
<br>

<p>Then he examines the Face or Edge of the <i>Rule</i>,
whether it have an Edge of an equal breadth all the
whole Length, and that the Edge be neither too thick
nor too fine for his porpose.</p>

<p>He should also take care that the <i>Brass</i>, before it
be cut out, be well and skilfully Planish’t, nor would
that charge be ill bestowd; for it would be saved
out of the thickness of the <i>Brass</i> that is commonly
used: For the <i>Joyners</i> being unskilful in Planishing,
buy Neal’d thick <i>Brass</i> that the <i>Rule</i> may be strong
enough, and so cut it into slips without Hammering,
which makes the <i>Rule</i> easily bow any way and stand
so, and will never come to so good and smooth an
Edge as Planish’t <i>Brass</i> will. Besides, <i>Brass</i> well Planish’t
will be stiffer and stronger at half the thickness
than unplanish’t <i>Brass</i> will at the whole: As I shall
further shew when I come to Exercise upon <i>Mathematical
Instrument-making</i>.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 3. <i>Of</i> Cases.</h3>

<p>Next he provides <i>Cases</i>. A Pair of <i>Cases</i> is an <i>Upper-Case</i>
and a <i>Lower-Case</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Upper-Case</i> and the <i>Lower-Case</i> are of an equal
length, breadth and depth, <i>viz.</i> Two Foot nine Inches
long, One Foot four Inches and an half broad, and
about an Inch and a quarter deep, besides the bottom
Board; But for small Bodied <i>Letters</i> they are made
somewhat shallower, and for great Bodies deeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p><i>Long-Primmer</i> and downwards are accounted small
Bodies; <i>English</i> and upwards are accounted great
Bodies.</p>

<p>The conveniencies of a shallow <i>Case</i> is, that the
<i>Letters</i> in each Box lye more visible to the last, as
being less shadowed by the sides of the <i>Boxes</i>.</p>

<p>The conveniencies of a deep <i>Case</i> is, that it will
hold a great many <i>Letters</i>, so that a <i>Compositer</i> needs
not so often <i>Destribute</i>. 2dly. It is not so soon <i>Low</i>,
(as <i>Compositers</i> say when the <i>Case</i> grows towards empty)
and a <i>Low Case</i> is unconvenient for a <i>Compositer</i>
to work at, partly because the <i>Case</i> standing shelving
downwards towards them, the <i>Letters</i> that are in
the <i>Case</i> tend towards the hither-side of the <i>Case</i>,
and are shadowed by the hither side of that <i>Box</i> they
lye in, so that they are not so easily seen by the Eye,
or so ready to come at with the Fingers, as if they
lay in the middle of the <i>Box</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>Cases</i> are encompassed about with a <i>Frame</i>
about Three quarters of an Inch broad, that the ends
of the several partitions may be let into the substance
of the <i>Frame</i>: But the hithermost side of the
<i>Frame</i> is about half an Inch higher than the other
sides, that when either the <i>Galley</i> or another pair of
<i>Cases</i> are set upon them, the bottom edge of the <i>Galley</i>,
or of those <i>Cases</i> may stop against that higher
<i>Frame</i>, and not slide off.</p>

<p>Both the <i>Upper</i> and the <i>Lower-Case</i> have a thick
Partition about three quarters of an Inch broad,
Duff-tail’d into the middle of the upper and under
Rail of the <i>Frame</i>. This Partition is made thus broad,
that Grooves may be made on either side of it to receive

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>

the ends of those Partitions that devide the
breadth of the <i>Case</i>, and also to strengthen the whole
<i>Frame</i>; for the bottom Board is as well nailed to this
thick Partition as to the outer <i>Frame</i> of the <i>Case</i>.</p>

<p>But the devisions for the several <i>Boxes</i> of the <i>Upper</i>
and <i>Lower-Cases</i> are not alike: for each half of
the whole length of the <i>Upper-Case</i> is devided into
seven equal parts, as you may see in Plate 1. at A,
and its breadth into seven equal parts, so that the
whole <i>Upper-Case</i> is divided into Ninety eight square
<i>Boxes</i>, whose sides are all equal to one another.</p>

<p>But the Two halfs of the length of the <i>Lower-Case</i>
are not thus devided; for each half of the length
of the <i>Lower-Case</i> is devided into Eight equal parts,
and its breadth into Seven; but it is not throughout
thus devided neither; for then the <i>Boxes</i> would be all
of equal size: But the <i>Lower-Case</i> is devided into four
several sizes of <i>Boxes</i>, as you may see in Plate 1. B.</p>

<p>The reason of these different sizes of <i>Boxes</i> is,
That the biggest <i>Boxes</i> may be disposed nearest the
<i>Compositers</i> hand, because the English Language, and
consequently all English <i>Coppy</i> runs most upon such
and such Sorts; so that the <i>Boxes</i> that holds those
Sorts ought to be most capacious.</p>

<p>His care in the choice of these <i>Cases</i> is, That the
Wood they are made of be well-season’d Stuff.</p>

<p>That the Partitions be strong, and true let into one
another, and that the ends fill up and stand firm in the
Grooves of the <i>Frame</i> and middle <i>Rail</i> of the <i>Case</i>.</p>

<p>There is an inconvenience that often happens, these
thin Partitions, especially if they be made of unseason’d
Stuff, <i>viz.</i> as the Stuff dries it shrinks in the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>

Grooves of the <i>Frame</i>, and so not only grows loose,
but sometimes starts out above the top of the <i>Frame</i>.
To prevent this inconvenience, I have of late caused
the ends of these thin partitions to be made Male-Duf-tails,
broadest on the under-side, and have them
fitted into Female-Duf-tails in the Frame of the <i>Case</i>,
and middle Rail before the bottom Boards are nailed on.</p>

<p>That the Partitions be full an <i>English</i> Body thick.</p>

<p>That the Partitions lye close to the bottom of the
<i>Case</i>, that so the <i>Letters</i> slide not through an upper
into an under <i>Box</i>, when the Papers of the <i>Boxes</i>
may be worn.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 4. <i>Of</i> Frames <i>to set the</i> Cases <i>on</i>.</h3>

<p><i>Frames</i> are in most <i>Printing-Houses</i> made of thick
<i>Deal-board Battens</i>, having their several <i>Rails Tennanted</i>
into the <i>Stiles</i>: but these sorts of <i>Frames</i> are, in
respect of their matter (<i>viz.</i> <i>Fir</i>) so weak, and in respect
of their substance (<i>viz.</i> little above an Inch thick) so
slight, that experience teaches us, when they are even
new made, they tremble and totter, and having lasted
a little while, the thinness of their <i>Tennants</i> being a
little above a quarter of an Inch thick, according to
the Rules of <i>Joynery</i>, as I have shewn in <i>Numb.</i> 5.
§. 17. They Craze, their <i>Tennants</i> break, or <i>Mortesses</i>
split, and put the <i>Master-Printer</i> to a fresh Charge.</p>

<p>It is rationally to be imagined that the <i>Frames</i> should
be designed to last as long as the <i>Printing-house</i>; and
therefore our <i>Master-Printer</i> ought to take care that
they be made of matter strong enough, and of substance
big enough to do the Service they are intended

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>

for; that they stand substantial and firm in their place,
so as a small Jostle against them shake them not,
which often reiterated weakens the <i>Frame-work</i>, and
at that present is subject to shake the <i>Letter</i> in the
<i>Galley</i> down.</p>

<p>I shall not offer to impose Rules upon any here,
especially since I have no Authority from Prescript
or Custom; yet I shall set down the Scantlings that
I my self thought fit to use on this occasion. A Delineation
of the <i>Frames</i> are in Plate 1. at C.</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>a a a a</i> The <i>Fore-Rails.</i></li>
<li><i>b b b b</i> The <i>Hind-Rails.</i></li>
<li><i>c</i> The <i>Top Fore-Rail.</i></li>
<li><i>d</i> The <i>Bottom Fore-Rail.</i></li>
<li><i>e</i> The <i>Top Hind-Rail.</i></li>
<li><i>f</i> The <i>Bottom Hind-Rail.</i></li>
<li><i>g g g g</i> The <i>End-Rail.</i></li>
<li><i>h h h h Cross-Bearers.</i></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>I made the <i>Rails</i> and <i>Stiles</i> of well-seasoned fine
<i>Oak</i>, clean, (that is free from Knots and Shakes) the
<i>Stiles</i> and <i>Rails</i> two Inches and an half square, the
Top and Bottom <i>Fore-Rails</i> and the Bottom <i>Hind-Rail</i>
four Foot three Inches long, besides their <i>Tennants</i>;
And the Top <i>Hind-Rail</i> five Foot three Inches
long. The two <i>Fore-Rails</i> and Bottom <i>Hind-Rail</i> had
Iron Female-Screws let into them, which, through
an hole made in the <i>Stiles</i>, received a Male-Screw
with a long shank, and a Sholder at the end of it to
screw them tight and firm together, even as the
Rails of a <i>Bedsted</i> are screwed into the <i>Mortesses</i> of a
<i>Bed-Post</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Each <i>Back-Stile</i> was four Foot one Inch and an half
high besides their <i>Tennants</i>, and each <i>Fore-Stile</i> three
Foot three Inches high, each <i>Fore</i> and <i>Back-Stile</i> had
two <i>Rails</i> one Foot seven Inches long, besides their
<i>Tennants</i> Tennanted and Pin’d into them, because not
intended to be taken assunder.</p>

<p>It must be considered, that the <i>Fore-stiles</i> be of a
convenient height for the pitch of an ordinary Man
to stand and work at, which the heighth aforesaid is;
And that the <i>Hind stiles</i> be so much higher than the
<i>Fore-stiles</i>, that when the <i>Cross-Bearers</i> are laid upon
the upper <i>Fore</i> and <i>Hind-Rail</i>, and the <i>Cases</i> laid on
them, the <i>Cases</i> may have a convenient declivity from
the upper-side the <i>Upper-Case</i>, to the lower side the
<i>Lower-Case</i>.</p>

<p>The Reason of this declivity is, because the <i>Cases</i>
standing thus before the Workman, the farther <i>Boxes</i>
of the <i>Upper-Case</i> are more ready and easie to come
at, than if they lay flat; they being in this position
somewhat nearer the hand, and the <i>Letters</i> in those
<i>Boxes</i> somewhat easier seen.</p>

<p>If the Workman prove taller than Ordinary, he
lays another or two pair of <i>Cases</i> under the <i>Cases</i> he
uses, to mount them: If the Workman be short, as
Lads, <i>&amp;c.</i> He lays a <i>Paper-board</i> (or sometimes two)
on the floor by the Fore-side of the <i>Frame</i>, and standing
to work on it, mounts himself.</p>

<p>The <i>Bearers</i> are made of <i>Slit-Deal</i>, about two Inches
broad, and so long as to reach from the <i>Fore-Rail</i>
through the <i>Upper-Rail</i>, and are let in, so as to lye
even with the superficies of the <i>Fore</i> and <i>Hind-Rail</i>,
and at such a distance on both the <i>Rails</i>, as you may
see in the Figure.</p>

<br>
<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p024b.png" width="600" height="854" alt="Image: Plate 2.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 2.</i></span>
</div>
<br>
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>On the Superficies of the <i>Fore-Rail</i>, even with its
Fore-Edge is nailed a small <i>Riglet</i> about half an Inch
high, and a quarter and half quarter of an Inch
thick, that the <i>Cases</i> set on the <i>Frame</i> having the
aforesaid declivity, may by it be stop’t from sliding
off.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 5. <i>Of the</i> Galley.</h3>

<p>Our <i>Master-Printer</i> is also to provide <i>Galleys</i> of different
sizes, That the <i>Compositer</i> may be suited with
small ones when he <i>Composes</i> small <i>Pages</i>, and with
great ones for great <i>Pages</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Galley</i> is marked A in Plate 2.</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>a b c</i> The Sides or Frame of the <i>Galley</i>.</li>
<li><i>d</i> The <i>Slice</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>These <i>Galleys</i> are commonly made of two flat
<i>Wainscot Boards</i>, each about a quarter and half quarter
of an Inch thick, the uppermost to slide in
Grooves of the Frame, close down to the undermost,
though for small <i>Pages</i> a single Board with two sides
for the Frame may serve well enough: Those <i>Wainscot
Boards</i> are an Oblong Square, having its length
longer than its breadth, even as the form of a <i>Page</i>
hath. The three Sides of the Frame are fixed fast
and square down on the upper Plain of the undermost
Board, to stand about three fifth parts of the
height of the <i>Letter</i> above the superficies of the <i>Slice</i>.
The Sides of the Frame must be broad enough to admit
of a pretty many good strong <i>Oaken Pins</i> along

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>

the Sides, to be drove hard into the Bottom Board,
and almost quite through the Sides of the Frame,
that the Frame may be firmly fixed to it: But by no
means must they be Glewed on to the Bottom Board,
because the <i>Compositer</i> may sometimes have occasion
to wet the <i>Page</i> in the <i>Galley</i>, and then (the <i>Galley</i>
standing aslope upon the <i>Case</i>) the Water will soak
between the sides of the Frame, and under Board, and
quickly loosen it.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 6. <i>Of the</i> Correcting-stone.</h3>

<p>The <i>Correcting-Stone</i> marked B in Plate 2. is made
of <i>Marble</i>, <i>Purbeck</i>, or any other Stone that may be
made flat and smooth: But yet the harder the Stone
is the better; wherefore <i>Marble</i> is more preferable
than <i>Purbeck</i>. First, Because it is a more compact
Stone, having fewer and smaller Pores in it than <i>Purbeck</i>.
And Secondly, because it is harder, and therefore
less subject to be prick’d with the corners of a
<i>Chase</i>, if through carelessness (as it sometimes happens)
it be pitch’d on the Face of the Stone.</p>

<p>It is necessary to have it capacious, <i>viz.</i> large enough
to hold two <i>Chases</i> and more, that the <i>Compositer</i>
may sometimes for his convenience, set some
<i>Pages</i> by on it ready to <i>Impose</i>, though two <i>Chases</i> lye
on the <i>Stone</i>: Therefore a <i>Stone</i> of about Four Foot
and an half long, and Two Foot broad is a convenient
size for the generality of Work.</p>

<p>This <i>Stone</i> is to be laid upon a strong <i>Oaken</i>-wood
Frame, made like the Frame of a common Table, so
high, that the Face of the <i>Stone</i> may lye about three

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>

Foot and an Inch above the Floor: And under the
upper Rail of the Frame may be fitted a Row or
two of Draw-Boxes, as at <i>a a a a a a</i> and <i>b b b</i> on
each of its longest Sides to hold <i>Flowers</i>, <i>Brass-Rules</i>,
<i>Braces</i>, <i>Quotations</i>, small <i>Scabbords</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 7. <i>Of</i> Letter-Boards, <i>and</i> Paper-Boards.</h3>

<p><i>Letter-Boards</i> are Oblong Squares, about two
Foot long, eighteen Inches broad, and an Inch and a
quarter thick. They ought to be made of clean and
well-season’d Stuff, and all of one piece: Their upper-side
is to be Plained very flat and smooth, and their
under-side is Clamped with pieces about two Inches
square, and within about four Inches of either end,
as well to keep them from Warping, as to bear them
off the Ground or any other Flat they stand on, that
the Fingers of the <i>Compositer</i> may come at the bottom
of the Board to remove it whither he will:
They are commonly made of <i>Fir</i>, though not so
thick as I have mentioned, or all of one Piece: <i>Deal-Boards</i>
of this breadth may serve to make them of;
but <i>Joyners</i> commonly put <i>Master-Printers</i> off with
ordinary <i>Deal-Boards</i>, which not being broad enough,
they joyn two together; for which cause they frequently
shrink, so as the joynt comes assunder, and
the <i>Board</i> becomes useless, unless it be to serve for a
<i>Paper-Board</i> afterwards: For small and thin <i>Letters</i>
will, when the Form is open, drop through, so as
the <i>Compositer</i> cannot use the Board.</p>

<p>I us’d to make them of <i>Sugar-Chest</i>; That Stuff being
commonly well-season’d, by the long lying of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
<i>Sugar</i> in it, and is besides a fine hard Wood, and
therefore less subject to be injured by the end of the
<i>Shooting-Stick</i> when a <i>Form</i> is <i>Unlocking</i>.</p>

<p><i>Paper-Boards</i> are made just like the <i>Letter-Boards</i>,
though seldom so large, unless for great Work: Nor
need such strict care be taken in making them so exactly
smooth: their Office being only to set <i>Heaps of
Paper</i> on, and to <i>Press</i> the <i>Paper</i> with.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 8. <i>Of</i> Furniture, Quoyns, Scabbord, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>By <i>Furniture</i> is meant the <i>Head-sticks</i>, <i>Foot-sticks</i>,
<i>Side-sticks</i>, <i>Gutter-sticks</i>, <i>Riglets</i>, <i>Scabbords</i> and <i>Quoyns</i>.</p>

<p><i>Head-sticks</i> and all other <i>Furniture</i>, except <i>Scabbord</i>,
are made of dry <i>Wainscot</i>, that they may not shrink
when the <i>Form</i> stands by; They are <i>Quadrat</i> high,
straight, and of an equal thickness all the length:
They are made of several thicknesses for several
Works, <i>viz.</i> from a <i>Brevier</i> which serves for some
<i>Quarto’s</i> to six or eight <i>Pica</i> thick, which is many
times us’d to <i>Folio’s</i>: And many of the <i>Head-sticks</i>
may also serve to make Inner <i>Side-sticks</i> of; for the
<i>Master-Printer</i> provides them of lengths long enough
for the <i>Compositer</i> to cut to convenient Scantlins or
Lengths, they being commonly about a Yard long
when they come from the <i>Joyners</i>. And <i>Note</i>, that
the <i>Head</i> and <i>Side-sicks</i> are called <i>Riglets</i>, if they
exceed not an <i>English</i> thick.</p>

<p>Outer <i>Side-sticks</i> and <i>Foot-sticks</i> marked C in Plate
2. are of the same heighth of the <i>Head-sticks</i>, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Quadrat</i> high, and are by the <i>Joyner</i> cut to the given
length, and to the breadth of the particular <i>Pages</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>

that are to be <i>Imposed</i>: The <i>Side-sticks</i> are placed
against the outer-side of the <i>Page</i>, and the <i>Foot-sticks</i>
against the foot or bottom of the <i>Page</i>: The outer-sides of
these <i>Side</i> and <i>Foot-sticks</i> are bevil’d or sloped from the
further to the hither end.</p>

<p><i>Gutter-sticks</i> marked D in Plate 2. are as the former,
<i>Quadrat</i> high, and are used to set between <i>Pages</i>
on either side the <i>Crosses</i>, as in <i>Octavo’s</i>, <i>Twelves</i>,
<i>Sixteens</i>, and <i>Forms</i> upwards; They are made of
an equal thickness their whole length, like <i>Head-sticks</i>;
but they have a Groove, or Gutter laid on the
upper-side of them, as well that the Water may
drain away when the <i>Form</i> is Washed or Rinced, as
that they should not <i>Print</i>, when through the tenderness
of the <i>Tinpan</i>, the <i>Plattin</i> presses it and the
<i>Paper</i> lower than ordinary.</p>

<p><i>Scabbord</i> is that sort of <i>Scale</i> commonly sold by
some <i>Iron-mongers</i> in Bundles; And of which, the
<i>Scabbords</i> for <i>Swords</i> are made: The <i>Compositer</i> cuts
it <i>Quadrat</i> high, and to his Length.</p>

<p>The <i>Master-Printer</i> is to provide both <i>Thick</i> and
<i>Thin Scabbord</i>, that the <i>Compositer</i> may use either when
different Bodied <i>Letter</i> happens in a <i>Page</i>, to justifie
the <i>Page</i> to a true length; And also that the <i>Press-man</i>
may chuse <i>Thick</i> or <i>Thin</i> to make truer <i>Register</i>,
as shall be shewed in proper place.</p>

<p><i>Quoyns</i> are also <i>Quadrat</i> high, and have one of
their sides Bevil’d away to comply with the Bevil
of the <i>Side</i> and <i>Foot-sticks</i>; they are of different
Lengths, and different Breadths: The great <i>Quoyns</i>
about three Inches square, except the Bevil on one
side as aforesaid; and these sizes deminish downwards

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>

to an Inch and an half in length, and half an Inch
in breadth.</p>

<p>Of these <i>Quoyns</i> our <i>Master-Printer</i> provides several
hundreds, and should provide them of at the least
ten different Breadths between the aforesaid sizes,
that the <i>Compositer</i> may chuse such as will best fit the
<i>Chase</i> and <i>Furniture</i>.</p>

<p>The Office of these <i>Quoyns</i> are to <i>Lock</i> up the
<i>Form</i>, <i>viz.</i> to wedge it up (by force of a <i>Mallet</i>
and <i>Shooting-stick</i>) so close together, both on the
sides and between Head and Foot of the <i>Page</i>, that
every <i>Letter</i> bearing hard against every next <i>Letter</i>,
the whole <i>Form</i> may <i>Rise</i>; as shall be shewed hereafter.</p>

<p>Their farther Office is to make <i>Register</i> at the
<i>Press</i>.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 9. ¶. 1. <i>Of the</i> Mallet, Shooting-stick
<i>and</i> Dressing-Block, Composing-sticks,
Bodkin, <i>and</i> Chase. <i>&amp;c.</i></h3>

<p><i>Printers Mallets</i> have a <i>Cilindrick</i> Head, and a
round Handle; The Head somewhat bigger, and the
Handle somewhat longer than those <i>Joyners</i> commonly
use; Yet neither shape or size different for
any reason to be given: But only a Custom always
used to have them so. The Head is commonly made
of <i>Beech</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of the</i> Shooting-stick.</h4>

<p>The <i>Shooting-stick</i> must be made of <i>Box</i>, which
Wood being very hard, and withal tough, will best
and longest endure the knocking against the <i>Quoyns</i>.
Its shape is a perfect Wedge about six Inches long,
and its thicker end two Inches broad, and an Inch
and an half thick; and its thin end about an Inch
and an half broad, and half an Inch thick.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of the</i> Dressing-Block.</h4>

<p>The <i>Dressing-Block</i> should be made of <i>Pear-tree</i>,
Because it is a soft wood, and therefore less subject
to injure the Face of the <i>Letter</i>; it is commonly about
three Inches square, and an Inch high. Its Office
is to run over the Face of the <i>Form</i>, and whilst
it is thus running over, to be gently knock’t upon
with the Head of the <i>Shooting stick</i>, that such <i>Letters</i>
as may chance to stand up higher than the rest may
be pressed down.</p>

<p>Our <i>Master-Printer</i> must also provide a pair of
<i>Sheers</i>, such as <i>Taylors</i> use, for the cutting of <i>Brass-Rules</i>,
<i>Scabbords</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A large <i>Spunge</i> or two, or more, he must also
provide, one for the <i>Compositers</i> use, and for every
<i>Press</i> one.</p>

<p>Pretty fine <i>Packthread</i> to tye up <i>Pages</i> with; But
this is often chosen (or at least directed) by the <i>Compositer</i>,
either finer or courser, according to the great
or small <i>Letter</i> he works upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of the</i> Composing-stick.</h4>

<p>Though every <i>Compositer</i> by Custom is to provide
himself a <i>Composing-stick</i>, yet our <i>Master-Printer</i> ought
to furnish his House with these Tools also, and such a
number of them as is suitable to the size of his House;
Because we will suppose our <i>Master-Printer</i> intends to
keep some Apprentices, and they, unless by contract
or courtesie, are not used to provide themselves <i>Composing-sticks</i>:
And besides, when several <i>Compositers</i> work
upon the same Book, their Measures are all set alike,
and their <i>Titles</i> by reason of <i>Notes</i> or <i>Quotations</i>
broader than their common Measure, So that a <i>Composing-stick</i>
is kept on purpose for the <i>Titles</i>, which
must therefore be common to all the <i>Compositers</i> that
work upon that Work; And no one of them is obliged
to provide a <i>Composing-stick</i> in common for them
all: Therefore it becomes our <i>Master-Printers</i> task
to provide them.</p>

<p>It is delineated in Plate 2. at <i>E</i>.</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>a</i> The <i>Head</i>.</li>
<li><i>b b</i> The <i>Bottom</i>.</li>

<li><i>f f</i> The <i>Male-Screw</i>.</li>
<li><i>g</i> The <i>Female-Screw</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>These <i>Composing-sticks</i> are made of Iron Plate about
the thickness of a thin <i>Scabbord</i>, and about ten

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>

Inches long doubled up square; so as the Bottom
may be half an Inch and half a quarter broad,
and the Back about an whole Inch broad. On the
further end of this Iron Plate thus doubled up, as
at <i>a</i> is Soldered on an Iron Head about a <i>Long-Primmer</i>
thick; But hath all its outer-edges Basil’d
and Fil’d away into a Molding: This Iron Head must
be so let into the Plate, and Soldered on to it, that
it may stand truly square with the bottom, and also
truly square with the Back, which may be known
by applying the outer-sides of a square to the Back
and Bottom; as I shewed, <i>Numb.</i> 3. <i>Fol.</i> 38, 39.
About two Inches from the Head, in the Bottom, is
begun a row of round holes about an Inch assunder,
to receive the shank of the <i>Male-Screw</i> that screws
the <i>Sliding-Measures</i> fast down to the Bottom; so that
the <i>Sliding-Measures</i> may be set nearer or further
from the Head, as the Measure of a <i>Page</i> may require.</p>

<p>The lower <i>Sliding-Measure</i> marked <i>d</i> is an Iron
Plate a <i>thick Scabbord</i> thick, and of the Breadth of
the inside of the Bottom; It is about four Inches
long, and in its middle hath a Groove through it
within half an Inch of the Fore-end, and three quarters
of an Inch of the hinder end. This Groove is so
wide all the way, that it may receive the Shank of the
<i>Screw</i>. On the Fore-end of this Plate stands square upright
another Iron Head about a <i>Brevier</i> thick, and
reaches so high as the top of the Back.</p>

<p>The upper <i>Sliding-Measure</i> is made just like the
lower, only it is about three quarters of an Inch
shorter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Between these two <i>Sliding-Measures</i>, <i>Marginal Notes</i>
are <i>Composed</i> to any Width.</p>

<p><i>Compositers</i> commonly examine the Truth of their
<i>Stick</i> by applying the head of the <i>Sliding-Measure</i> to
the inside of the Head of the <i>Stick</i>; and if they comply,
they think they are square and true made: But this Rule
only holds when the Head it self is square. But if it
be not, ’tis easy to file the <i>Sliding-Measures</i> to comply
with them: Therefore, as aforesaid, the square
is the only way to examine them by.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Of the</i> Bodkin.</h4>

<p>The <i>Bodkin</i> is delineated in Plate 2. at <i>F</i> Its <i>Blade</i>
is made of <i>Steel</i>, and well tempered, its shape is
round, and stands about two Inches without the <i>Shank</i>
of the <i>Handle</i>. The <i>Handle</i> is turned of soft wood
as <i>Alder</i>, <i>Maple</i>, &amp;c. that when <i>Compositers</i> knock
the Head of the <i>Bodkin</i> upon the Face of a Single
<i>Letter</i> when it stands too high, it may not batter the
Face.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 6. <i>Of</i> Chases, <i>marked</i> G <i>on the</i> Correcting-Stone,
<i>Plate</i> 2.</h4>

<p>A <i>Chase</i> is an Iron Frame about two and twenty
Inches long, eighteen Inches broad, and half Inch
half quarter thick; and the breadth of Iron on every
side is three quarters of an Inch: But an whole Inch
is much better, because stronger. All its sides must
stand exactly square to each other; And when it is
laid on the <i>Correcting-Stone</i> it must lye exactly flat,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>

<i>viz.</i> equally bearing on all its sides and Angles: The
outside and inside must be Filed straight and smooth.
It hath two <i>Crosses</i> belonging to it, <i>viz.</i> A <i>Short-Cross</i>
marked <i>a a</i> and a <i>Long-Cross</i> marked <i>b b</i>: These
two <i>Crosses</i> have on each end a Male Duftail Filed
Bevil away from the under to the upper-side of the
<i>Cross</i>, so that the under-side of the Duftail is narrower
than the upper-side of the Duftail. These Male-Duftails
are fitted into Female-Duftails, Filed in the
inside of the <i>Chase</i>, which are also wider on the upper
side of the <i>Chase</i> than on the under-side; because
the upper-side of the <i>Cross</i> should not fall through
the lower side. These <i>Crosses</i> are called the <i>Short</i> and
the <i>Long-Cross</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Short-Cross</i> is Duftail’d in as aforesaid, just in
the middle of the <i>Chase</i> as at <i>c c</i>, and the <i>Long-Cross</i> in
the middle of the other sides the <i>Chase</i>, as at <i>d d</i>. The
<i>Short-Cross</i> is also Duftail’d into Female-Duftails, made
as aforesaid, about three Inches and an half from the
middle, as at <i>e e</i>: So that the <i>Short-Cross</i> may be
put into either of the Female-Duftails as occasion
serves. The middle of these two <i>Crosses</i> are Filed
or notched half way through, one on its upper, the
other on its under-side to let into one another, <i>viz.</i>
the <i>Short-Cross</i> is Filed from the upper towards the
under-side half way, and the <i>Long-Cross</i> is Filed from
the lower towards the upper-side half way: The
<i>Crosses</i> are also thus let into each other, where they
meet at <i>f</i>, when the <i>Short-Cross</i> is laid into the other
Female-Duftails fitted to it at <i>e e</i>.</p>

<p>In the middle, between the two edges of the upper
side of the <i>Short-Cross</i>, is made two Grooves parallel

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>

to the sides of the <i>Cross</i>, beginning at about
two Inches from each end, and ending at about seven
Inches from each end: It is made about half an
Inch deep all the way, and about a quarter of an
Inch broad, that the <i>Points</i> may fall into them. The
<i>Short-Cross</i> is about three quarters of an Inch thick,
and the <i>Long-Cross</i> about half that thickness. All
their sides must be Fil’d straight and smooth, and
they must be all the way of an equal thickness.</p>

<p>Hitherto our <i>Master-Printer</i> hath provided Materials

<h3>§. 10. <i>Of the</i> Press.</h3>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">T</span>Here are two sorts of <i>Presses</i> in use, <i>viz.</i>
the old fashion and the new fashion;
The old fashion is generally used here
in <i>England</i>; but I think for no other
reason, than because many <i>Press-men</i>
have scarce Reason enough to distinguish between an
excellently improved Invention, and a make-shift
slovenly contrivance, practiced in the minority of
this Art.</p>

<p>The New-fashion’d <i>Presses</i> are used generally
throughout all the <i>Low-Countries</i>; yet because the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>

Old-fashion’d <i>Presses</i> are used here in <i>England</i> (and
for no other Reason) I have in Plate 3. given you a
delineation of them; But though I give you a draft
of them; yet the demensions of every particular Member
I shall omit, referring those that think it worth
their while, to the <i>Joyners</i> and <i>Smiths</i> that work to
<i>Printers</i>: But I shall give a full description of the
New-fashion’d <i>Press</i>, because it is not well known
here in <i>England</i>; and if possible, I would for Publick
benefit introduce it.</p>

<p>But before I proceed, I think it not amiss to let
you know who was the Inventer of this New-fashion’d
<i>Press</i>, accounting my self so much oblig’d to
his Ingeniety for the curiosity of this contrivance,
that should I pass by this oppertunity without nameing
him, I should be injurious to his Memory.</p>

<p>It was <i>Willem Jansen Blaew</i> of <i>Amsterdam</i>: a Man
as well famous for good and great <i>Printing</i>, as for his
many <i>Astronomical</i> and <i>Geographical</i> exhibitions to
the World. In his Youth he was bred up to <i>Joynery</i>,
and having learn’d his Trade, betook himself (according
to the mode of <i>Holland</i>) to Travel, and his
fortune leading him to <i>Denmark</i>, when the noble <i>Tycho
Brahe</i> was about setting up his <i>Astronomical Observatory</i>,
was entertain’d into his service for the
making his Mathematical-Instruments to Observe
withal; in which Instrument-making he shew’d himself
so intelligent and curious, that according to the
general report of many of his personal acquaintance,
all or most of the <i>Syderal Observations</i> set forth in
<i>Tycho’s</i> name, he was intrusted to make, as well as
the Instruments.</p>

<br>
<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p038b.png" width="600" height="865" alt="Image: Plate 4.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 4.</i></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>And before these Observations were publish’d to
the World, <i>Tycho</i>, to gratify <i>Blaew</i>, gave him the
Copies of them, with which he came away to <i>Amsterdam</i>,
and betook himself to the making of <i>Globes</i>, according
to those Observations. But as his Trade increased,
he found it necessary to deal in <i>Geographical
Maps</i> and <i>Books</i> also, and grew so curious in <i>Engraving</i>,
that many of his best <i>Globes</i> and <i>Maps</i> were <i>Engraved</i>
by his own Hands; and by his conversation in
<i>Printing</i> of Books at other <i>Printing-houses</i>, got such
insight in this Art, that he set up a <i>Printing-house</i> of
his own. And now finding inconveniencies in the
obsolete Invention of the <i>Press</i>, He contrived a remedy
to every inconvenience, and fabricated nine
of these New-fashioned <i>Presses</i>, set them all on a
row in his <i>Printing-house</i>, and call’d each <i>Press</i> by the
name of one of the <i>Muses</i>.</p>

<p>This short History of this excellent Man is, I
confess forraign to my Title; But I hope my Reader
will excuse the digression, considering it tends only
to the commemoration of a Person that hath deserved
well of Posterity, and whose worth without
this small Monument, might else perhaps have slid
into Oblivion.</p>

<p>But because the smallness of this altogether-Draft

description, and large delineation of every Member in
the <i>Press</i>: And first of the Wooden-work: Where,
<i>Note</i>, that all the Fram’d Wooden-work of a <i>Press</i> is
made of Good, Fine, Clean, Well-season’d <i>Oak</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 1. <i>Of the</i> Feet.</h4>

<p>The <i>Feet</i> (marked <i>a a</i> in Plate 5.) are two Foot
nine Inches and an half long, five Inches deep; and
six Inches broad, and have their outsides Tryed to a
true square, as was taught, <i>Numb.</i> 5. §. 15. It hath
(for ornament sake) its two ends bevil’d away in a Molding,
from its upper-side to its lower, about four Inches
within the ends; about four Inches and three quarters
within each end of each Foot is made in the
middle of the Breadth of the upper-side of the Foot
a Mortess two Inches wide, to receive the <i>Tennants</i>
of the lower end of the <i>Cheek</i>, and the <i>Tennant</i> of
the lower end of the <i>Hind-Post</i>: The Mortess for
the <i>Cheek</i> is eight Inches long, <i>viz.</i> the Breadth of
the <i>Cheek</i>: And the Mortess for the Hind-Post is four
Inches long, <i>viz.</i> the square of the <i>Hind-Post</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of the</i> Cheeks.</h4>

<p>The <i>Cheeks</i> (marked <i>b b</i> in Plate 5.) are five Foot
and ten Inches long (besides the <i>Tennants</i> of the top

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>

and bottom) eight Inches broad, and four Inches and
an half thick. All its Sides are tryed square to one another.
It hath a <i>Tennant</i> at either end, its lower
<i>Tennant</i> marked <i>a</i> to enter the Fore-end of the Foot,
runs through the middle of the Breadth of the <i>Cheek</i>,
which therefore is made to fit the Mortess in the <i>Foot</i>,
and is about four Inches long, and therefore reaches
within an Inch of the bottom of the <i>Foot</i>; But the
<i>Tennant</i> at the upper end of the <i>Cheek</i> marked <i>a</i>, is
cut athwart the breadth of the <i>Cheek</i>, and therefore
can have but four Inches and an half of Breadth, and
its thickness is two Inches, Its length is four Inches;
so that it reaches into the Mortess in the <i>Cap</i>, within
half an Inch of the Top.</p>

<p>In the lower end-<i>Tennant</i> is two holes bored, within
an Inch and an half of either side, and within an
Inch and an half of the Sholder, with a three quarter
Inch <i>Augure</i>, to be pin’d into the <i>Feet</i> with an Iron
Pin.</p>

<p>In the middle of the upper <i>Tennant</i>, and within
an Inch and an half of the Sholder, is bored another
hole, to Pin the <i>Tennant</i> into the <i>Cap</i>, also with an Iron
Pin.</p>

<p>Between <i>b c</i> two Foot and half an Inch, and
three Foot seven Inches of the Bottom-Sholder of the
<i>Tennant</i>, <i>viz.</i> from the top of the <i>Winter</i> to the under
Sholder the <i>Till</i> rests upon, is cut flat away into the
thickness of the <i>Cheek</i>, three Inches in the Inside
of the <i>Cheek</i>; so that in that place the <i>Cheek</i> remains
but an Inch and an half thick: And the <i>Cheeks</i> are thus
widened in this place, as well because the Duftail <i>Tennants</i>
of the <i>Winter</i> may go in between them, as also

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>

that the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Coffin</i> may be made the wider.</p>

<p>Even with the lower Sholder of this flat cutting-in,
is made a Duftail Mortess as at <i>d</i>, to reach eight
Inches and an half, <i>viz.</i> the depth of the <i>Winter</i> below
the said Sholder. This Mortess is three Inches
wide on the inside the <i>Cheek</i>, and three Inches deep;
But towards the inside the <i>Cheek</i>, the Mortess widens
in a straight line from the said three Inches to five
Inches, and so becomes a Duftail Mortess. Into this
Duftail Mortess is fitted a Duftail <i>Tennant</i>, made at
each end of the <i>Winter</i>.</p>

<p>Two Inches above the aforesaid Cutting-in, is another
cutting-in of the same depth, from the Inside
the <i>Cheek</i> as at <i>e</i>. This cutting-in is but one Inch
broad at the farther side the <i>Cheek</i>, and an Inch and
a quarter on the hither-side the <i>Cheek</i>. The under-side
of this Cutting-in, is straight through the <i>Cheek</i>,
<i>viz.</i> Square to the sides of the <i>Cheek</i>: But the
upper-side of this Cutting-in, is not square through
the <i>Cheeks</i>, But (as aforesaid) is one quarter of an Inch
higher on the fore-side the <i>Cheek</i> than it is on the
further side; So that a Wedge of an Inch at one
end, and an Inch and a quarter at the other end may fill
this Cutting-in.</p>

<p>At an Inch within either side the <i>Cheek</i>, and an Inch
below this Cutting-in, as at <i>f f</i>, is made a small
Mortess an Inch and an half wide, to which two <i>Tennants</i>
must be fitted at the ends of the <i>Till</i>, so that
the <i>Tennants</i> of the <i>Till</i> being slid in through the
Cutting-in aforesaid, may fall into these Mortesses,
and a Wedge being made fit to the Cutting-in, may
press upon the <i>Tennants</i> of the <i>Till</i>, and force it
down to keep it steddy in its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Here we see remains a square Sholder or substance
of Wood between two Cuttings-in; But the under
corner of this square Sholder is for Ornament sake
Bevil’d away and wrought into an <i>Ogee</i>.</p>

<p>At two Inches above the last Cutting-in, is another
Cutting-in, but this Cutting-in goes not quite
through the breadth of the <i>Cheek</i>, but stops at an
Inch and an half within the further side the <i>Cheek</i>;
So that above the <i>Till</i> and its <i>Wedge</i> is another Sholder
or substance of Wood, whose upper Corner is also
Bevil’d away, and wrought to a Molding as the former.</p>

<p>The last Cutting-in is marked <i>g</i>, and is eight Inches
and a quarter above the Sholder of the <i>Till</i>, that
it may easily contain the depth of the <i>Head</i>; The
substance remaining is marked <i>h</i>. This Cutting-in is
made as deep into the thickness of the <i>Cheek</i> as the
former Cuttings-in are, <i>viz.</i> three Inches; and
the reason the <i>Cheek</i> is cut in here, is, that the <i>Cheeks</i>
may be wide enough in this place to receive the <i>Head</i>,
and its <i>Tennants</i>, without un-doing the <i>Cap</i> and <i>Winter</i>.</p>

<p>Just above this Cutting-in is made a square Mortess
in the middle of the <i>Cheek</i>, as at <i>i</i>, it is eight Inches
long, and two Inches and an half wide, for the
<i>Tennant</i> of the <i>Head</i> to play in.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon the fore-side of the <i>Cheek</i> is (for Ornament
sake) laid a Molding through the whole length of
the <i>Cheek</i> (a square at the Top and Bottom an Inch
deep excepted) it is laid on the outer side, and therefore
can be but an Inch broad; Because the Cuttings-in
on the inside leaves the substance of Stuff but an

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>

Inch and an half thick, and should the Moldings be
made broader, it would be interrupted in the several
Cuttings in, or else a square of a quarter of an
Inch on either side the Molding could not be allowed,
which would be ungraceful.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of the</i> Cap <i>marked</i> c <i>in Plate</i> 5.</h4>

<p>The <i>Cap</i> is three Foot and one Inch long, four Inches
and an half deep, and nine Inches and an half broad;
But its fore-side is cut away underneath to eight Inches,
<i>Viz.</i> the breadth of the <i>Cheeks</i>. Three quarters
of an Inch above the bottom of the <i>Cap</i>, is a small
<i>Facia</i>, which stands even with the thickness of the
<i>Cheeks</i>; Half an Inch above that a Bead-Molding,
projecting half an Inch over the <i>Facia</i>. Two Inches
above that a broad <i>Facia</i>, also even with the thickness
of the <i>Cheeks</i>; and an Inch and a quarter above
that is the upper Molding made projecting an Inch
and an half over the two <i>Facia</i>’s aforesaid, and the
thickness of the <i>Cheeks</i>.</p>

<p>Each end of the <i>Cap</i> projects three Inches quarter
and half quarter over the <i>Cheeks</i>, partly for Ornament,
but more especially that substance may be
left on either end beyond the Mortesses in the Cap;
and these two ends have the same Molding laid on
them that the fore-side of the <i>Cap</i> hath.</p>

<p>Within two Inches and half quarter of either end,
on the under-side the <i>Cap</i> is made a square Mortess
two Inches wide, and four Inches and an half long,
<i>viz.</i> the thickness of the <i>Cheek</i> inwards, as at <i>a a</i>, to
receive the Top <i>Tennants</i> of the <i>Cheeks</i>; which Top

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>

<i>Tennants</i> are with an Iron Pin (made tapering of about
three quarters of an Inch thick) pin’d into the Mortess
of the <i>Cap</i>, to keep the <i>Cheeks</i> steddy in their position.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of the</i> Winter <i>marked</i> d <i>in</i> Plate 5.</h4>

<p>The Length of the <i>Winter</i> besides the <i>Tennants</i>, is
one Foot nine Inches and one quarter of an Inch;
The Breadth of the <i>Winter</i> eight Inches, <i>viz.</i> the
Breadth of the <i>Cheek</i>, and its depth nine Inches; all
its sides are tryed square; But its two ends hath each
a Duftail-<i>Tennant</i> made through the whole depth
of the <i>Winter</i>, to fit and fall into the Duftail Mortesses
made in the <i>Cheeks</i>: These Duftail-<i>Tennants</i> are intended
to do the Office of a <i>Summer</i>, Because the
spreading of the ends of these two <i>Tennants</i> into the
spreading of the Mortesses in the <i>Cheeks</i>, keeps the
two <i>Cheeks</i> in a due distance, and hinders them from
flying assunder.</p>

<p>But yet I think it very convenient to have a <i>Summer</i>
also, the more firmly and surer to keep the <i>Cheeks</i>
together; This <i>Summer</i> is only a Rail <i>Tennanted</i>, and
let into Mortesses made in the inside of the <i>Cheeks</i>,
and Screwed to them as the Rails described, <i>Numb.</i>
15. §. 4. are Screwed into the Stiles of the <i>Case-Frame</i>;
Its depth four Inches and an half, and
its breadth eight Inches, <i>viz.</i> the breadth of the
<i>Cheeks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Of the</i> Head <i>marked</i> e <i>in</i> Plate 5.</h4>

<p>The length of the <i>Head</i> besides the <i>Tennant</i> at
either end, is one Foot nine Inches and one quarter
of an Inch; The breadth eight Inches and an half,
and its depth eight Inches. The Top, Bottom and
Hind-sides are tryed Square, but the fore-side projects
half an Inch over the Range of the fore-sides of the
<i>Cheeks</i>; in which Projecture is cut a Table with a
hollow Molding about it, two Inches distant from all
the sides of the fore-side of the <i>Head</i>: Its <i>Tennants</i>
are three Inches Broad, and are cut down at either
end, from the top to the bottom of the <i>Head</i>,
and made fit to the Mortesses in the <i>Cheeks</i>, that they
may slide tight, and yet play in them.</p> 

<p>In the under-side of the <i>Head</i> is cut a square Hole,
(as at <i>a</i>,) about four Inches square, and three Inches and
an half deep, into which the <i>Brass-Nut</i> is to be fitted:
And to keep this <i>Nut</i> in its place (lest the weight of it
should make it fall out) is made on either side the square
hole, at about half an Inch distance from it, (as at <i>b b</i>)
a square Hole quite through the Top and Bottom of
the <i>Head</i> about three quarters of an Inch wide; and
into this square Hole is fitted a square piece of Iron
to reach quite through the <i>Head</i>, having at its under-end
a Hook turned square to claspe upon the under-side
of the <i>Nut</i>; and on its upper end a Male-Screw
reaching about an Inch above the upper-side of the
<i>Head</i>, which by the help of a Female-screw made
in an Iron <i>Nut</i>, with Ears to it to turn it about
draws the <i>Clasp</i> at the bottom of the Iron <i>Shank</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>

close against the <i>Nut</i>, and so keeps it from falling out.</p>

<p>In the middle of the wide square Hole that the
<i>Nut</i> is let into, is bored a round Hole through the
top of the <i>Head</i>, of about three quarters of an Inch
wide, for the <i>Press-man</i> to pour <i>Oyl</i> in at so oft as the
<i>Nut</i> and <i>Spindle</i> shall want <i>Oyling</i>.</p>

<p>At three Inches from either end of the <i>Head</i> (as at
<i>c c</i>) is bored a Hole quite through the top and bottom
of the <i>Head</i>, which holes have their under ends
squar’d about two Inches upwards, and these squares are
made so wide as to receive a square Bar of Iron three
quarters of an Inch square; But the other part of these
Holes remain round: Into these Holes two Irons are
fitted called the <i>Screws</i>.</p>

<p>The Shanks of these <i>Screws</i> are made so long as
to reach through the <i>Head</i> and through the <i>Cap</i>: At
the upper end of these Shanks is made Male-screws,
and to these Male-screws, Iron Female-screws are fitted
with two Ears to twist them the easier about.</p>

<p>So much of these Iron-Shanks as are to lye in the
square Hole of the <i>Head</i> aforesaid, are also squared
to fit those square Holes, that when they are fitted
and put into the Holes in the <i>Head</i>; they may not
twist about.</p>

<p>To the lower ends of these Iron-Shanks are made
two Square, Flat Heads, which are let into and buried
in the under-side of the <i>Head</i>; And upon the Sholders
of those two Flat Heads, rests the weight of the <i>Head</i>
of the <i>Press</i>; And by the <i>Screws</i> at the upper end
of the Shanks are hung upon the upper-side of the
<i>Cap</i>, and Screwed up or let down as occasion requires.</p>

<h4>¶. 6. <i>Of the</i> Till, <i>marked</i> f <i>in</i> Plate 5.</h4>

<p>The <i>Till</i> is a Board about one Inch thick, and is as
the <i>Head</i> and <i>Winter</i>, one Foot nine Inches and a quarter
long, besides the <i>Tennants</i> at either end; Its Breadth
is the Breadth of the <i>Cheeks</i>, <i>viz.</i> eight Inches; It
hath two <i>Tennants</i> at either end as at <i>a a a a</i>, each
of them about an Inch and an half long, and an Inch
and an half broad, and are made at an Inch distance
from the fore and Back-side, so that a space of two
Inches is contained in the middle of the ends between
the two <i>Tennants</i>; these <i>Tennants</i> are to be laid in the
Mortesses in the <i>Cheeks</i> delineated at <i>f f</i> in Plate 5.
and described in this §. 10. ¶. 2.</p>

<p>In its middle it hath a round Hole about two Inches
and an half wide, as at <i>b</i>, for the Shank of the <i>Spindle</i>
to pass through.</p>

<p>At seven Inches and a quarter from either end, and
in the middle between the fore and Back-side, is made
two square Holes through the <i>Till</i>, as at <i>c c</i>, for the
Iron <i>Hose</i> to pass through.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 7. <i>Of the</i> Hind-Posts <i>marked</i> a a <i>in</i>
Plate 6.</h4>

<p>At one Foot distance from the Hind-sides of the
<i>Cheeks</i> are placed upright two <i>Hind-Posts</i>, they are
three Foot and four Inches long besides the <i>Tennants</i>,
which <i>Tennants</i> are to be placed in the Mortesses in
the hinder-ends of the <i>Feet</i>; Their thickness is four
Inches on every side, and every side is tryed square;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>

But within eight Inches of the top is turned a round
Ball with a Button on it, and a Neck under it, and
under that Neck a straight Plinth or Base: This turn’d
work on the top is only for Ornament sake.</p>

<p>There are six <i>Rails</i> fitted into these <i>Hind-Posts</i>, two
behind marked <i>a b</i>, one of them standing with its
upper-side at two Inches below the turned Work, the
other having its upper-side lying level with the upper-side
of the <i>Winter</i>.</p>

<p>These two <i>Rails</i> are each of them <i>Tennanted</i> at
either end, and are made so long, that the outsides
of the <i>Hind-Posts</i> may stand Range or even with the
outer-sides of the <i>Cheeks</i>; These <i>Tennants</i> at either
end are let into Mortesses made in the insides of the
<i>Hind-Posts</i>, and Pin’d up with half Inch wooden Pins,
Glewed in, as was shewn Vol. 1. <i>Numb.</i> 5. §. 17. Because
the two <i>Hind-Posts</i> need not be separated for any alteration
of the <i>Press</i>.</p>

<p>The two <i>Side-Rails</i> on either side the <i>Press</i> are
<i>Tennanted</i> at each end, and let into Mortesses made
in the <i>Cheeks</i> and <i>Hind-Posts</i>, so as they may stand
Range with the outer-sides of the <i>Cheeks</i> and <i>Hind-Posts</i>;
But the <i>Tennants</i> that enter the Mortesses in
the <i>Cheeks</i> are not pin’d in with Wooden Pins, and
Glewed, because they may be taken assunder if need
be; But are Pin’d in with Iron Pins, made a little tapering
towards the entring end, so as they may be
driven back when occasion serves to alter the <i>Press</i>:
And the <i>Tennants</i> that enter the Mortesses in the <i>Hind-Posts</i>
are fastned in by a Female-screw, let in near the
end of the <i>Rail</i>, which receives a Male-screw thrust
through the <i>Hind-Posts</i>, even as I shew’d in</p>

was.</h3>

<br>
<h4>¶. 8. <i>Of the</i> Ribs <i>marked</i> b <i>in</i> Plate 6.</h4>

<p>The <i>Ribs</i> lye within a Frame of four Foot five
Inches long, one Foot eleven Inches broad; its two
<i>End-Rails</i> one Inch and an half thick, its <i>Side-Rails</i>
two Inches and an half thick; and the breadth of the
<i>Side</i> and <i>End-Rails</i> two Inches and an half. But the
<i>Side-Rails</i> are cut away in the inside an Inch and
an half towards the outer-sides of the <i>Rails</i>, and an
Inch deep towards the Bottom sides of the <i>Rails</i>, so
that a square <i>Cheek</i> on either <i>Side-Rail</i> remains. This
cutting down of the <i>Outer-Rails</i> of the <i>Frame</i> is made,
because the Planck of the <i>Carriage</i> being but one
Foot eight Inches and an half broad, may easily slide,
and yet be gaged between these <i>Cheeks</i> of the <i>Rail</i>,
that the <i>Cramp-Irons</i> Nailed under the <i>Carriage Planck</i>
joggle not on either side off the <i>Ribs</i>, as shall more
fully be shewn in the next §.</p>

<p>Between the two <i>Side-Rails</i> are framed into the
two <i>End-Rails</i> the two <i>Wooden-Ribs</i> two Inches and an
half broad, and an Inch and an half thick; they are
placed each at an equal distance from each <i>Side-Rail</i>,
and also at the same distance between themselves. Upon
these two <i>Ribs</i> are fast Nailed down the <i>Iron-Ribs</i>,
of which more shall be said when I come to speak of the Iron-work.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 9. <i>Of the</i> Carriage, Coffin <i>and its</i> Planck,
<i>marked</i> a <i>in</i> Plate 7.</h4>

<p>The <i>Planck</i> of the <i>Carriage</i> is an Elm-Planck an
Inch and an half thick, four Foot long, and one Foot
eight Inches and three quarters broad; upon this
<i>Planck</i> at its fore-end is firmly Nailed down a square
Frame two Foot four Inches long, one Foot ten
Inches broad, and the thickness of its Sides two Inches
and an half square; This Frame is called the <i>Coffin</i>,
and in it the <i>Stone</i> is <i>Bedded</i>.</p>

<p>Upon each of the four Corners of this <i>Coffin</i> is let
in and fastned down a square Iron Plate as at <i>a a a a</i>,
with Return Sides about six Inches long each side,
half a quarter of an Inch thick, and two Inches and
a quarter broad; upon the upper outer-sides of each
of these Plates is fastned down to them with two or
three Rivets through each side, another strong Iron
half an Inch deep, and whose outer Angles only are
square, but the Inner-Angles are obtuse, as being
sloped away from the Inner-Angle towards the farther end
of each inner-side, so as the <i>Quoins</i> may do
the Office of a Wedge between each inner-side and
the <i>Chase</i>.</p>

<br>
<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p052a.png" width="600" height="897" alt="Image: Plate 7.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 7.</i></span>
</div>
<br>

<p>The Plates of these Corners (as I said) are let in
on the outer Angles of the upper-side of the Frame
of the <i>Coffin</i>, so as the upper-sides of the Plates lye
even with it, and are Nailed down, or indeed rather
Rivetted down through the bottom and top-sides
of the Frame of the <i>Coffin</i>, because then the upper-sides
of the Holes in the Iron Plates being square

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>

Bored (that is, made wider on the upper-side of the
Plate, as I shall shew when I come to the making
of <i>Mathematical Instruments</i>) the ends of the Shanks
of the Iron Pins may be so battered into the Square-boring,
that the whole Superficies of the Plate when
thus Rivetted shall be smooth, which else with the
exturberancies of Nail-heads would hinder the free
sliding of the <i>Quoins</i>.</p>

<p>At the hinder end of the Frame of the <i>Coffin</i> are
fastned either with strong Nails, Rivets, or rather
Screws, two Iron <i>Half-Joynts</i>, as at <i>b b</i>, which having
an Iron Pin of almost half an Inch over put
through them, and two <i>Match-half-Joynts</i> fastned on
the Frame of the <i>Tympan</i>, these two <i>Match-half-Joynts</i>
moving upon the Iron Pin aforesaid, as on an <i>Axis</i>,
keeps the <i>Tinpan</i> so truly gaged, that it always falls
down upon the <i>Form</i> in the place, and so keeps <i>Register</i>
good, as shall further be shewed in proper place.</p>

<p>Behind the <i>Coffin</i> is Nailed on to its outside, a
Quarter, as at <i>c c</i> this Quarter is about three Inches
longer than the breadth of the <i>Coffin</i>, it hath all its
sides two Inches over, and three of them square;
but its upper-side is hollowed round to a Groove or
Gutter an Inch and an half over. This Gutter is so
Nailed on, that its hither end standing about an Inch
higher than its further end, the Water that descends
from the <i>Tympan</i> falling into it is carried away on
the farther side the <i>Coffin</i> by the declivity of the
farther end of the Gutter, and so keeps the Planck of
the <i>Carriage</i> neat and cleanly, and preserves it from
rotting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Parallel to the outer-sides of the hind part of the
Planck of the <i>Carriage</i>, at three Inches distance from
either side, is Nailed down on the upper-side of the
Planck two Female-Duftail Grooves, into which is
fitted (so as they may slide) two Male-Duftails made
on the two Feet of the <i>Gallows</i> (as at <i>d d</i>) that the
<i>Tinpan</i> rests upon; and by the sliding forward or
backward of these Duftail Feet, the heighth of the
<i>Tinpan</i> is raised or depressed according to the Reason
or Fancy of the <i>Press-man</i>.</p>

<p>At three Inches from the hinder Rail of the <i>Coffin</i>,
in the middle, between both sides of the Planck, is
cut an Hole four Inches square (as at <i>e e</i>) and upon
the hither and farther side of this Hole is fastned
down on each side a <i>Stud</i> made of Wood (as at
<i>f f</i>) and in the middle of these two <i>Studs</i> is made a
round Hole about half an Inch over, to receive the
two round ends of an Iron Pin; which Iron Pin,
though its ends be round, is through the middle of
the Shank square, and upon that square is fitted a
round <i>Wooden-Rowler</i> or <i>Barrel</i>, with a Shoulder on
either side it, to contain so much of the <i>Girt</i> as shall
be rowled upon it; And to one end of the <i>Rowler</i> is
fastned an Iron <i>Circle</i> or <i>Wheel</i>, having on its edge
<i>Teeth</i> cut to stop against a <i>Clicker</i>, when the <i>Rowler</i>
with an Iron Pin is turned about to strain the <i>Girt</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 10. <i>Of the</i> Tympan <i>and</i> Inner-Tympan,
<i>marked</i> b <i>in</i> Plate 7.</h4>

<p>The <i>Tympan</i> is a square Frame, three sides whereof
are Wood, and the fourth Iron. Its width is one

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>

Foot eight Inches, its length two Foot two Inches;
the breadth of the wooden Sides an Inch and an half,
and the depth one Inch.</p>

<p>On its short Wooden-side, <i>viz.</i> its Hind-end, at the
two Corners is Rivetted an Iron <i>Match-Joynt</i>, to be
pinned on to another <i>Half-joynt</i> fastned on the <i>Hind-Rail</i>
of the <i>Coffin</i>.</p>

<p>The other end, <i>viz.</i> the Fore-end of the <i>Tympan</i> is
made of Iron, with a square <i>Socket</i> at either end for
the Wooden ends of the <i>Tympan</i> to fit and fasten into.
This Iron is somewhat thinner and narrower than an
ordinary Window-Casement.</p>

<p>Upon the outer edge of this Iron, about an Inch
and an half off the ends of it, is made two Iron <i>Half-joynts</i>
to contain a Pin of about a quarter of an Inch
over, which Pin entring this <i>half-joynt</i>, and a <i>match
Half-joynt</i> made upon the <i>Frisket</i>, serves for the <i>Frisket</i>
to move truly upon.</p>

<p>In the middle of each long <i>Rail</i> of the <i>Tympan</i>, is
made through the top and bottom an Hole half an
Inch square, for the square Shanks of the <i>Point-Screws</i>
to fit into.</p>

<p>The like Holes are also made in the <i>Tympan</i>, at one
third part of its length from the Fore-end or <i>Frisket-joynt</i>,
to place the <i>Point Screws</i> in; when a <i>Twelves</i>,
<i>Eighteens</i>, &amp;c. is wrought.</p>

<p>Into the Inner-side of this <i>Tympan</i> is fitted the <i>Inner-Tympan</i>,
whose three sides are also made of Wood, and
its fourth side of Iron, as the <i>Tympan</i>, but without <i>joynts</i>;
it is made so much shorter than the <i>Outer-Tympan</i>, that
the outer edge of the Iron of the <i>Inner-Tympan</i> may
lye within the inner edge of the Iron on the <i>Outer-Tympan</i>;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>

and it is made so much narrower than the inside
of the <i>Tympan</i>, that a convenient room may be allowed
to paste a <i>Vellom</i> between the inside of the <i>Tympan</i>,
and the outside of the <i>Inner-Tympan</i>.</p>

<p>About the middle, through the hither-side of the
<i>Inner-Tympan</i>, is let in and fastned an Iron Pin about
a quarter of an Inch over, and stands out three quarters
of an Inch upon the hither outside of the <i>Inner-Tympan</i>,
which three quarters of an Inch Pin fits into
a round hole made in the inner-side of the <i>Tympan</i>, to
gage and fit the <i>Inner-Tympan</i> right into the <i>Tympan</i>;
for then by the help of an Iron turning <i>Clasp</i> on the
further side the <i>Tympan</i>, the <i>Inner-Tympan</i> is kept firmly
down and in its position.</p>

<h4>¶. 11. <i>Of the</i> Inck-Block, Slice, Brayer,<br>
<i>and</i> Catch <i>of the</i> Bar, <i>marked</i> c d e f
<i>in</i> Plate 7.</h4>

<p>To the <i>Rail</i> between the hither <i>Cheek</i> and <i>Hind-Post</i>
is fastned the <i>Inck-Block</i>, which is a Beechen-board
about thirteen Inches long, nine Inches broad, and
commonly about two Inches thick, and hath the
left-hand outer corner of it cut away; it is Railed in
on its farther and hinder-sides, and a little above half
the hither-side, with Wainscot-Board about three
quarters of an Inch thick, and two Inches and an
half above the upper-side the board of the <i>Inck-Block</i>.
It is described in Plate 7. at c.</p>

<p>The <i>Brayer</i> marked <i>a</i> is made of <i>Beech</i>: It is turned
round on the sides, and flat on the bottom, its length

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>

is about three Inches, and its diameter about two Inches
and an half; it hath an Handle to it about four
Inches long. Its Office is to rub and mingle the <i>Inck</i>
on the <i>Inck-Block</i> well together.</p>

<p>The <i>Slice</i> is a little thin Iron <i>Shovel</i> about three or
four Inches broad, and five Inches long; it hath an
Handle to it of about seven Inches long. Near the
<i>Shovel</i> through the Handle is fitted a small Iron of about
two Inches long standing Perpendicular to both
the sides of the Handle, and is about the thickness of
a small Curtain-Rod. It is described at e.</p>

<p>The <i>Catch</i> of the <i>Bar</i> described at f is a piece of
Wood two Inches thick, four Inches broad, and ten
Inches long; The top of it is a little Bevil’d or Slop’d
off, that the <i>Bar</i> may by its <i>Spring</i> fly up the Bevil till
it stick. This Bevil projects three Inches over its
straight Shank, which reaches down to the bottom;
in the middle of this Shank, through the fore and
back-side, is a Mortess made from within an Inch of
the Rounding to an Inch and an half of the bottom;
This Mortess is three quarters of an Inch wide, and
hath an Iron Pin with a Shoulder at one end fitted
to it, so as it may slide from one end of the Mortess
to the other. At the other end of the Iron Pin is
made a Male-Screw which enters into a Female Iron
Screw let into the further <i>Cheek</i> of the <i>Press</i>; so
that the <i>Catch</i> may be Screwed close to the <i>Cheek</i>, as
shall further be spoken to hereafter.</p>

<h4>¶. 12. <i>Of the Iron-work, and first of the</i>
Spindle <i>marked</i> A <i>in Plate</i> 8.</h4>

<p>From the Top to the <i>Toe</i> of the <i>Spindle</i>, <i>viz.</i> from
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i> is sixteen Inches and a half, the length of the
Cilinder the <i>Worms</i> are cut upon is three Inches and a
quarter, and the diameter of that Cilinder two Inches
and a quarter; between the bottom of the <i>Worms</i>
and top of the Cube one Inch and an half; the Cube
marked <i>c c c c</i> is two Inches and three quarters, the
square <i>Eye</i> at <i>d</i> in the middle of the Cube is an Inch
and a quarter through all the sides of the Cube; one
Inch under the Cube at <i>e</i> is the <i>Neck</i> of the <i>Spindle</i>,
whose diameter is two Inches, It is one Inch between
the two shoulders, <i>viz.</i> the upper and under shoulders
of the <i>Neck</i> at <i>e e</i>, so that the Cilinder of the
<i>Neck</i> is one Inch long; the very bottom of the <i>Spindle</i>
at <i>b</i> is called the <i>Toe</i>, it is made of an Hemispherical
form, and about one Inch in diameter; This <i>Toe</i>
should be made of <i>Steel</i>, and well Temper’d, that
by long or careless usage, the point of pressure wear
not towards one side of the <i>Toe</i>, but may remain in
the Axis of the <i>Spindle</i>.</p>

<h3>§. 11. <i>Of the</i> Worms <i>of the</i> Spindle.</h3>

<p>I promised at the latter end of <i>Numb.</i> 2. to give a
more copious account than there I did of making
<i>Worms</i>, when I came to exercise upon <i>Printing-Press
Spindles</i>; and being now arrived to it, I shall here
make good my promise.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 1. The <i>Worms</i> for <i>Printing-Press Spindles</i> must
be projected with such a declivity, as that they may
come down at an assigned progress of the <i>Bar</i>.</h4>

<p>The assigned progress may be various, and yet the
<i>Spindle</i> do its office: For if the <i>Cheeks</i> of the <i>Press</i>
stand wide assunder, the sweep or progress of the
same <i>Bar</i> will be greater than if they stand nearer
together.</p>

<p>It is confirm’d upon good consideration and Reason
as well as constant experience, that in a whole Revolution
of the <i>Spindle</i>, in the <i>Nut</i>, the <i>Toe</i> does and
ought to come down two Inches and an half; but
the <i>Spindle</i> in work seldom makes above one quarter
of a Revolution at one <i>Pull</i>, in which sweep it comes
down but half an Inch and half a quarter of an Inch;
and the reason to be given for this coming down, is
the squeezing of the several parts in the <i>Press</i>, subject
to squeeze between the Mortesses of the <i>Winter</i>
and the Mortesses the <i>Head</i> works in; and every
Joynt between these are subject to squeeze by the
force of a <i>Pull</i>. As first, The <i>Winter</i> may squeeze
down into its Mortess one third part of the thickness
of a <i>Scabbord</i>. (Allowing a <i>Scabbord</i> to be half a <i>Nomparel</i>
thick.) Secondly, The <i>Ribs</i> squeeze closer to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>

the <i>Winter</i> one <i>Scabbord</i>. Thirdly, The <i>Iron-Ribs</i>
to the Wooden <i>Ribs</i> one <i>Scabbord</i>. Fourthly, The
<i>Cramp-Irons</i> to the <i>Planck</i> of the <i>Coffin</i> one <i>Scabbord</i>.
Fifthly, The <i>Planck</i> it self half a <i>Scabbord</i>. Sixthly,
The <i>Stone</i> to the <i>Planck</i> one <i>Scabbord</i>. Seventhly,
The <i>Form</i> to the <i>Stone</i> half a <i>Scabbord</i>. Eighthly,
The <i>Justifyers</i> in the Mortess of the <i>Head</i> three <i>Scabbords</i>.
Ninthly, The <i>Nut</i> in the <i>Head</i> one <i>Scabbord</i>.
Tenthly, The <i>Paper</i>, <i>Tympans</i> and <i>Blankets</i> two
<i>Scabbords</i>. Eleventhly, Play for the Irons of the <i>Tympans</i>
four <i>Scabbords</i>. Altogether make fifteen <i>Scabbords</i>
and one third part of a <i>Scabbord</i> thick, which
(as aforesaid) by allowing two <i>Scabbords</i> to make a
<i>Nomparel</i>, and as I shewed in <i>Vol.</i> 2. <i>Numb.</i> 2. §. 2.
One hundred and fifty <i>Nomparels</i> to make one Foot,
gives twelve and an half <i>Nomparels</i> for an Inch, and
consequently twenty five <i>Scabbords</i> for an Inch;
so by proportion, fifteen <i>Scabbords</i> and one third part
of a <i>Scabbord</i>, gives five eighth parts of an Inch,
and a very small matter more, which is just so much
as the <i>Toe</i> of the <i>Spindle</i> comes down in a quarter of
a Revolution.</p>

<p>This is the Reason that the coming down of the
<i>Toe</i> ought to be just thus much; for should it be less,
the natural Spring that all these Joynts have, when
they are unsqueez’d, would mount the Irons of the
<i>Tympans</i> so high, that it would be troublesom and tedious
for the <i>Press-man</i> to <i>Run</i> them under the <i>Plattin</i>,
unless the <i>Cheeks</i> stood wider assunder, and consequently
every sweep of the <i>Bar</i> in a <i>Pull</i> exceed a
quarter of a Revolution, which would be both laborious
for the <i>Press-man</i>, and would hinder his usual
riddance of Work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>I shew’d in <i>Numb.</i> 2. <i>fol.</i> 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. the
manner of making a Screw in general; but assigned
it no particular Rise; which for the aforesaid reason,
these <i>Printing-Press Screws</i> are strictly bound to have:
Therefore its assigned Rise being two Inches and an
half in a Revolution, This measure must be set off
upon the Cilindrick Shank, from the top towards
the Cube of the <i>Spindle</i>, on any part of the <i>Cilinder</i>,
and there make a small mark with a fine <i>Prick-Punch</i>,
and in an exact Perpendicular to this mark make another
small mark on the top of the Cilinder, and
laying a straight <i>Ruler</i> on these two marks, draw a
straight line through them, and continue that line
almost as low as the Cube of the <i>Spindle</i>. Then devide
that portion of the straight line contained between
the two marks into eight equal parts, and set
off those equal parts from the two Inch and half
mark upwards, and then downwards in the line so
oft as you can: Devide also the Circumference of
the Shank of the Cilinder into eight equal parts, and
draw straight lines through each devision, parallel to
the first upright line; and describe the <i>Screw</i> as you
were directed in the afore-quoted place; so will you
find that the revolution of every line so carried on
about the Shank of the Cilinder, will be just two
Inches and an half off the top of the Shank: which
measure and manner of working may be continued
downward to within an Inch and an half of the Cube
of the <i>Spindle</i>. This is the Rule and Measure that
ought to be observ’d for ordinary <i>Presses</i>: But if for
some by-reasons the aforesaid Measure of two Inches
and an half must be varied, then the varied Measure

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>

must be set off from the top of the Cilinder, and
working with that varied Measure as hath been directed,
the <i>Toe</i> of the <i>Spindle</i> will come down lower
in a revolution if the varied Measure be longer, or
not so low if the varied Measure be shorter.</p>

<p>There is a Notion vulgarly accepted among Workmen,
that the <i>Spindle</i> will Rise more or less for the
number of <i>Worms</i> winding about the Cilinder; for
they think, or at least by tradition are taught to say,
that a <i>Three-Worm’d Spindle</i> comes faster and lower
down than a <i>four-Worm’d Spindle</i>: But the opinion
is false; for if a <i>Spindle</i> were made but with a <i>Single-Worm</i>,
and should have this Measure, <i>viz.</i> Two
Inches and an half set off from the top, and a <i>Worm</i>
cut to make a Revolution to this Measure, it would
come down just as fast, and as low, as if there were
two, three, four, five or six <i>Worms</i>, &amp;c. cut in the
same Measure: For indeed, the numbers of <i>Worms</i>
are only made to preserve the <i>Worms</i> of the <i>Spindle</i>
and <i>Nut</i> from wearing each other out the faster; for
if the whole stress of a <i>Pull</i> should bear against the
Sholder of a single <i>Worm</i>, it would wear and shake
in the <i>Nut</i> sooner by half than if the stress should
be borne by the Sholders of two <i>Worms</i>; and so proportionably
for three, four, five <i>Worms</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>But the reason why four <i>Worms</i> are generally made
upon the <i>Spindle</i>, is because the Diameters of the <i>Spindle</i>
are generally of this propos’d size; and therefore a
convenient strength of Mettal may be had on this
size for four <i>Worms</i>; But should the Diameter of the
<i>Spindle</i> be smaller, as they sometimes are when the
<i>Press</i> is designed for small Work, only three <i>Worms</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>

will be a properer number than four; because when
the Diameter is small, the thickness of the <i>Worms</i>
would also prove small, and by the stress of a <i>Pull</i>
would be more subject to break or tear the <i>Worms</i>
either of the <i>Spindle</i> or <i>Nut</i>.</p>

<p>And thus I hope I have performed the promise here
I made at the latter end of <i>Numb.</i> 2. Whither I refer
you for the breadth, and reason of the breadth of
the <i>Worm</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 13. <i>Of the</i> Bar <i>marked</i> B <i>in</i> Plate 8.</h4>

<p>This <i>Bar</i> is Iron, containing in length about two
Foot eight Inches and an half, from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and its
greatest thickness, except the Sholder, an Inch and a
quarter; The end <i>a</i> hath a Male-Screw about an Inch
Diameter and an Inch long, to which a <i>Nut</i> with a
Female-Screw in it as at C is fitted. The Iron <i>Nut</i>
in which this Female-Screw is made, must be very
strong, <i>viz.</i> at least an Inch thick, and an Inch and
three quarters in Diameter; in two opposite sides
of it is made two Ears, which must also be very
strong, because they must with heavy blows be knock’t
upon to draw the Sholder of the square shank on the
<i>Bar</i>, when the square Pin is in the <i>Eye</i> of the <i>Spindle</i>
close and steddy up to the Cube on the <i>Spindle</i>. The
square Pin of the <i>Bar</i> marked <i>c</i> is made to fit just
into the <i>Eye</i>, through the middle of the Cube
of the <i>Spindle</i>, on the hither end of this square Pin
is made a Sholder or stop to this square Pin, as at <i>d</i>.
This Sholder must be Filed exactly Flat on all its four
insides, that they may be drawn close and tight up

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>

to any flat side of the Cube on the <i>Spindle</i>; It is two
Inches square, that it may be drawn the firmer, and
stop the steddyer against any of the flat sides of the
said Cube, when it is hard drawn by the strength
of the Female-Screw in the aforesaid <i>Nut</i> at C. The
thickness from <i>d</i> to <i>e</i> of this Sholder is about three
quarters of an Inch, and is Bevil’d off towards the
<i>Handle</i> of the <i>Bar</i> with a small Molding.</p>

<p>The substance of this <i>Bar</i>, as aforesaid, is about an
Inch and a quarter; but its Corners are all the way
slatted down till within five Inches of the end: And
from these five Inches to the end, it is taper’d away,
that the <i>Wooden-Handle</i> may be the stronger forced
and fastned upon it.</p>

<p>About four Inches off the Sholder, the <i>Bar</i> is bowed
beyond a right Angle, yet not with an Angle, but a
Bow, which therefore lies ready to the <i>Press-man</i>’s
Hand, that he may Catch at it to draw the <i>Wooden-Handle</i>
of the <i>Bar</i> within his reach.</p>

<p>This <i>Wooden-Handle</i> with long Working grows oft
loose; but then it is with hard blows on the end of
it forced on again, which oft splits the <i>Wooden-Handle</i>
and loosens the square Pin at the other end of the <i>Bar</i>,
in the <i>Eye</i> of the <i>Spindle</i>: To remedy which inconvenience,
I used this Help, <i>viz.</i> To weld a piece of
a Curtain-Rod as long as the <i>Wooden-Handle</i> of the
<i>Bar</i>, to the end of the Iron <i>Bar</i>, and made a Male-screw
at the other end with a Female-screw to fit it;
Then I bored an hole quite through the <i>Wooden-Handle</i>,
and Turn’d the very end of the <i>Wooden-Handle</i>
with a small hollow in it flat at the bottom, and deep
enough to bury the Iron-<i>Nut</i> on the end of the Curtain-Rod,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>

and when this Curtain-Rod was put through
the Hollow in the <i>Wooden-Handle</i> and Screwed fast to
it at the end, it kept the <i>Wooden-Handle</i>, from flying
off; Or if it loosened, by twisting the <i>Nut</i> once or
twice more about, it was fastned again.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 14. <i>Of the</i> Hose, Garter, <i>and</i> Hose-Hooks.</h4>

<p>The <i>Hose</i> are the upright Irons in Plate 8. at <i>a a</i>,
They are about three quarters of an Inch square, both
their ends have Male-screws on them; The lower
end is fitted into a square Hole made at the parting
of the <i>Hose-Hooks</i>, which by a square <i>Nut</i> with a Female-screw
in it, is Screwed tight up to them; Their
upper ends are let into square Holes made at the ends
of the <i>Garter</i>, and by <i>Nuts</i> with Female-Screws in
them, and Ears to turn them about as at <i>l l</i> are
drawn up higher, if the <i>Plattin-Cords</i> are too loose;
or else let down lower if they are too tight: These upper
Screws are called the <i>Hose-Screws</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Garter</i> (but more properly the <i>Coller</i>) marked
<i>b b</i>, is the round Hoop incompassing the flat Groove
or Neck in the Shank of the <i>Spindle</i> at <i>e e</i>; This
round Hoop is made of two half-round Hoops, having
in a Diametrical-line without the Hoop square Irons
of the same piece proceeding from them, and standing
out as far as <i>g g</i>, These Irons are so let into each
other, that they comply and run Range with the
square Sholders at both ends, wherein square Holes
are made at the ends of the <i>Hose</i>. They are Screwed
together with two small Screws, as at <i>h h</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>The four <i>Hose-Hooks</i> are marked <i>i i i i</i>, They proceed
from two Branches of an Iron Hoop at <i>k</i> encompassing
the lower end of the <i>Spindle</i>, on either
Corner of the Branch, and have notches filled in their
outer-sides as in the Figure, which notches are to contain
several Turns of <i>Whip-cord</i> in each notch, which
<i>Whip-cord</i> being also fastned to the <i>Hooks</i> on the <i>Plattin</i>,
holds the <i>Plattin</i> tight to the <i>Hooks</i> of the <i>Hose</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 15. <i>Of the</i> Ribs, <i>and</i> Cramp-Irons.</h4>

<p>The <i>Ribs</i> are delineated in Plate 8. at E, they
are made of four square Irons the length of the <i>Wooden-Ribs</i>
and <i>End-Rails</i>, <i>viz.</i> four Foot five Inches
long, and three quarters of an Inch square, only one
end is batter’d to about a quarter of an Inch thick, and
about two Inches and an half broad, in which battering
four or five holes are Punch’t for the nailing
it down to the <i>Hind-Rail</i> of the <i>Wooden-Ribs</i>. The
Fore-end is also batter’d down as the Hind-end, but
bound downwards to a square, that it may be nailed
down on the outer-side of the <i>Fore-Rail</i> of the <i>Wooden-Ribs</i>.</p>

<p>Into the bottom of these <i>Ribs</i>, within nine Inches
of the middle, on either side is made two Female-Duftails
about three quarters of an Inch broad, and
half a quarter of an Inch thick, which Female-Duftails
have Male-Duftails as at <i>a a a a</i> fitted stiff into
them, about an Inch and three quarters long; and
these Male-Duftails have an hole punched at either
end, that when they are fitted into the Female-Duftails
in the <i>Ribs</i>, they may in these Holes be Nailed
down the firmer to the <i>Wooden-Ribs</i>.</p>

<br>
<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p066b.png" width="600" height="822" alt="Image: Plate 9.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 9.</i></span>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>These <i>Ribs</i> are to be between the upper and the
under-side exactly of an equal thickness, and both
to lye exactly Horizontal in straight lines; For irregularities
will both Mount and Sink the <i>Cramp-Irons</i>,
and make them <i>Run</i> rumbling upon the <i>Ribs</i>.</p>

<p>The upper-sides of these <i>Ribs</i> must be purely
Smooth-fil’d and Pollish’d, and the edges a little Bevil’d
roundish away, that they may be somewhat
Arching at the top; because then the <i>Cramp-Irons</i>
<i>Run</i> more easily and ticklishly over them.</p>

<p>The <i>Cramp-Irons</i> are marked F in Plate 8. They
are an Inch and an half long besides the Battering
down at both ends as the <i>Ribs</i> were; They have
three holes Punched in each Battering down, to Nail
them to the <i>Planck</i> of the <i>Coffin</i>; They are about
half an Inch deep, and one quarter and an half thick;
their upper-sides are smoothed and rounded away as
the <i>Ribs</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 16. <i>Of the</i> Spindle <i>for the</i> Rounce, <i>described
in Plate</i> 9. <i>at</i> a.</h4>

<p>The <i>Axis</i> or <i>Spindle</i> is a straight Bar of Iron about
three quarters of an Inch square, and is about three
Inches longer than the whole breadth of the Frame of
the <i>Ribs</i>, <i>viz.</i> two Foot two Inches: The farther end of
it is Filed to a round Pin (as at <i>a</i>) three quarters of
an Inch long, and three quarters of an Inch in Diameter;
the hither end is filed away to such another
round Pin, but is two Inches and a quarter long (as
at <i>b</i>); at an Inch and a quarter from this end is Filed
a Square Pin three quarters of an Inch long, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>

within half an Inch of the end is Filed another round
Pin, which hath another Male-Screw on it, to which
is fitted a square Iron <i>Nut</i> with a Female-Screw in it.</p>

<p>On the Square Pin is fitted a <i>Winch</i> somewhat in
form like a Jack-winch, but much stronger; the <i>Eye</i>
of which is fitted upon the Square aforesaid, and
Screwed up tight with a Female-Screw. On the
straight Shank of this Winch is fitted the <i>Rounce</i>,
marked <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The round ends of this <i>Axis</i> are hung up in two
Iron-Sockets (as at <i>c c</i>) fastned with Nails (but
more properly with Screws) on the outside the Wooden
Frame of the <i>Ribs</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Girt-Barrel</i> marked <i>d</i> is Turned of a Piece of
Maple or Alder-wood, of such a length, that it may
play easily between the two Wooden <i>Ribs</i>; and of
such a diameter, that in one revolution of it, such a
length of <i>Girt</i> may wind about it as shall be equal
to half the length contained between the fore-end
Iron of the <i>Tympan</i>, and the inside of the Rail of the
<i>Inner-Tympan</i>; because two Revolutions of this <i>Barrel</i>
must move the <i>Carriage</i> this length of space.</p>

<p>This <i>Barrel</i> is fitted and fastned upon the Iron <i>Axis</i>,
at such a distance from either end, that it may move
round between the Wooden <i>Ribs</i> aforesaid.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 17. <i>Of the</i> Press-Stone.</h4>

<p>The <i>Press-Stone</i> should be Marble, though sometimes
Master <i>Printers</i> make shift with Purbeck, either
because they can buy them cheaper, or else because
they can neither distinguish them by their appearance,
or know their different worths.</p>

<p>Its thickness must be all the way throughout equal,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>

and ought to be within one half quarter of an
Inch the depth of the inside of the <i>Coffin</i>; because
the matter it is <i>Bedded</i> in will raise it high enough.
Its length and breadth must be about half an Inch less
than the length and breadth of the inside of the <i>Coffin</i>:
Because <i>Justifiers</i> of Wood, the length of every
side, and almost the depth of the <i>Stone</i>, must be thrust
between the insides of the <i>Coffin</i> and the outsides of
the <i>Stone</i>, to Wedge it tight and steddy in its place,
after the <i>Press-man</i> has <i>Bedded</i> it. Its upper-side, or
Face must be exactly straight and smooth.</p>

<p>I have given you this description of the <i>Press-Stone</i>,
because they are thus generally used in all <i>Printing-Houses</i>:
But I have had so much trouble, charge and
vexation with the often breaking of <i>Stones</i>, either
through the carelesness or unskilfulness (or both)
of <i>Press-men</i>, that necessity compell’d me to consider
how I might leave them off; and now by long experience
I have found, that a piece of <i>Lignum-vitæ</i>
of the same size, and truly wrought, performs the
office of a <i>Stone</i> in all respects as well as a <i>Stone</i>,
and eases my mind, of the trouble, charge and vexation
aforesaid, though the first cost of it be greater.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 18. <i>Of the</i>
Plattin <i>marked</i> d <i>in Plate</i> 9.</h4>

<p>The <i>Plattin</i> is commonly made of Beechen-Planck,
two Inches and an half thick, its length about fourteen
Inches, and its breadth about nine Inches. Its
sides are Tryed Square, and the Face or under-side of
the <i>Plattin</i> Plained exactly straight and smooth.
Near the four Corners on the upper-side, it hath

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>

four Iron <i>Hooks</i> as at <i>a a a a</i>, whose Shanks are
Wormed in.</p>

<p>In the middle of the upper-side is let in and fastned
an Iron Plate called the <i>Plattin-Plate</i>, as <i>b b b b</i>,
a quarter of an Inch thick, six Inches long, and four
Inches broad; in the middle of this Plate is made a
square Iron Frame about half an Inch high, and half
an Inch broad, as at <i>c</i>. Into this square Frame is
fitted the <i>Stud</i> of the <i>Plattin Pan</i>, so as it may stand
steddy, and yet to be taken out and put in as occasion
may require.</p>

<p>The <i>Stud</i> marked <i>d</i>, is about an Inch thick, and
then spreads wider and wider to the top (at <i>e e e e</i>)
of it, till it becomes about two Inches and an half
wide; and the sides of this spreading being but about
half a quarter of an Inch thick makes the <i>Pan</i>. In
the middle of the bottom of this <i>Pan</i> is a small Center
hole Punch’d for the <i>Toe</i> of the <i>Spindle</i> to work in.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 19. <i>Of the</i> Points <i>and</i> Point-Screws.</h4>

<p>The Points are made of Iron Plates about the
thickness of a Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> Shilling: It is delineated
at e in Plate 9. which is sufficient to shew the
shape of it, at the end of this Plate, as at <i>a</i>, stands
upright the Point. This <i>Point</i> is made of a piece of
small Wyer about a quarter and half quarter of an
Inch high, and hath its lower end Filed away to a small
Shank about twice the length of the thickness of the
Plate; so that a Sholder may remain. This small
Shank is fitted into a small Hole made near the end
of the Plate, and Revetted on the other side, as was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>

taught <i>Numb.</i> 2. <i>Fol.</i> 24. At the other end of the
Plate is filed a long square notch in the Plate as at <i>b c</i>
quarter and half quarter Inch wide, to receive the
square shank of the <i>Point-Screws</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Point-Screw</i> marked f is made of Iron; It
hath a thin Head about an Inch square, And a square
Shank just under the Head, an Inch deep, and almost
quarter and half quarter Inch square, that the square
Notch in the hinder end of the Plate may slide on
it from end to end of the Notch; Under this square
Shank is a round Pin filed with a Male-Screw upon
it, to which is fitted a <i>Nut</i> with a Female-Screw in
it, and Ears on its outside to twist about, and draw
the Head of the Shank close down to the <i>Tympan</i>,
and so hold the <i>Point-Plate</i> fast in its Place.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 20. <i>Of the</i> Hammer, <i>described at</i> h, <i>and</i>
Sheeps-Foot <i>described at</i> i <i>in Plate</i> 9.</h4>

<p>The <i>Hammer</i> is a common <i>Hammer</i> about a quarter
of a Pound weight; It hath no <i>Claws</i> but a <i>Pen</i>,
which stands the <i>Press-man</i> instead when the <i>Chase</i>
proves so big, that he is forced to use small <i>Quoins</i>.</p>

<p>The Figure of the <i>Sheeps-Foot</i> is description sufficient.
Its use is to nail and un-nail the <i>Balls</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Sheeps-Foot</i> is all made of Iron, with an Hammer-head
at one end, to drive the <i>Ball-Nails</i> into the
<i>Ball-Stocks</i>, and a Claw at the other end, to draw
the <i>Ball-Nails</i> out of the <i>Ball-Stocks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 21. <i>Of the</i> Foot-step, Girts, Stay <i>of the</i>
Carriage, Stay <i>of the</i> Frisket, Ball-Stocks,<br>
Paper-Bench, Lye-Trough, Lye-Brush,
Lye-Kettle, Tray <i>to</i> wet Paper<br>
<i>in</i>, Weights to Press Paper, Pelts, <i>or</i>
Leather, Wool <i>or</i> Hair, Ball-Nails <i>or</i>
Pumping-Nails.</h4>

<p>The <i>Foot-Step</i> is an Inch-Board about a Foot broad,
and sixteen Inches long. This Board is nailed upon a
piece of Timber about seven or eight Inches high,
and is Bevil’d away on its upper-side, as is also the
Board on its under-side at its hither end, that the
Board may stand aslope upon the Floor. It is placed
fast on the Floor under the Carriage of the Press.
Its Office shall be shewed when we come to treat of
Exercise of the <i>Press-man</i>.</p>

<p><i>Girts</i> are Thongs of Leather, cut out of the Back
of an Horse-hide, or a Bulls hide, sometimes an
Hogs-hide. They are about an Inch and an half,
or an Inch and three quarters broad. Two of them
are used to carry the <i>Carriage</i> out and in. These
two have each of them one of their ends nailed to
the <i>Barrel</i> on the <i>Spindle</i> of the <i>Rounce</i>, and the other
ends nailed to the <i>Barrel</i> behind the <i>Carriage</i> in the
<i>Planck</i> of the <i>Coffin</i>, and to the <i>Barrel</i> on the fore-end
of the Frame of the <i>Coffin</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Stay</i> of the <i>Carriage</i> is sometimes a piece of the
same <i>Girt</i> fastned to the outside of the further <i>Cheek</i>,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>

and to the further hinder side of the Frame of the
<i>Carriage</i>. It is fastned at such a length by the <i>Press-man</i>,
that the <i>Carriage</i> may ride so far out, as that the Irons
of the <i>Tympan</i> may just rise free and clear off the fore-side
of the <i>Plattin</i>.</p>

<p>Another way to stay the <i>Carriage</i> is to let an Iron
Pin into the upper-side of the further Rail of the
Frame of the <i>Ribs</i>, just in the place where the further
hinder Rail of the <i>Carriage</i> stands projecting over the
<i>Rib-Rail</i>, when the Iron of the <i>Tympan</i> may just rise
free from the Fore-side of the <i>Plattin</i>; for then that
projecting will stop against the Iron Pin.</p>

<p>The <i>Stay</i> of the <i>Frisket</i> is made by fastning a Batten
upon the middle of the Top-side of the <i>Cap</i>, and
by fastning a Batten to the former Batten perpendicularly
downwards, just at such a distance, that the
upper-side of the <i>Frisket</i> may stop against it when
it is turned up just a little beyond a Perpendicular.
When a <i>Press</i> stands at a convenient distance from a
Wall, that Wall performs the office of the aforesaid <i>Stay</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ball-Stocks</i> are Turn’d of <i>Alder</i> or <i>Maple</i>. Their Shape
is delineated in Plate 9. at g: They are about seven Inches
in Diameter, and have their under-side Turned hollow,
to contain the greater quantity of <i>Wool</i> or <i>Hair</i>,
to keep the <i>Ball-Leathers</i> plump the longer.</p>

<p>The <i>Lye-Trough</i> (delineated in Plate 9. at k) is a
Square Trough made of Inch-Boards, about four
Inches deep, two Foot four Inches long, and one Foot
nine Inches broad, and flat in the Bottom. Its inside
is Leaded with Sheet-Lead, which reaches up over
the upper Edges of the <i>Trough</i>. In the middle of
the two ends (for so I call the shortest sides) on the
outer-sides as <i>a a</i>, is fastned a round Iron Pin, which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>

moves in a round hole made in an Iron Stud with a
square Sprig under it, to be drove and fastned into a
<i>Wooden Horse</i>, which <i>Horse</i> I need not describe, because
in Plate aforesaid I have given you the Figure of it.</p>

<p>The <i>Paper-Bench</i> is only a common Bench about 
three Foot eight Inches long, one Foot eight Inches
broad, and three Foot four Inches high. </p>

<p>The <i>Lye-Brush</i> is made of <i>Hogs-Bristles</i> fastned into
a Board with Brass-Wyer, for durance sake: Its
Board is commonly about nine Inches long, and four
and an half Inches broad; and the length of the
Bristles about three Inches. </p>

<p>To perform the Office of a <i>Lye-Kettle</i> (which
commonly holds about three Gallons) the old-fashion’d
<i>Chafers</i> are most commodious, as well because
they are more handy and manageable than <i>Kettles</i>
with Bails, as also because they keep <i>Lye</i> longer hot. </p>

<p>The <i>Tray</i> to <i>Wet Paper</i> in is only a common Butchers
Tray, large enough to <i>Wet</i> the largest <i>Paper</i> in.</p>

<p>The <i>Weight</i> to <i>Press Paper</i> with, is either Mettal, or
Stone, flat on the Bottom, to ly steddy on the <i>Paper-Board</i>:
It must be about 50 or 60 pound weight. </p>

<p>For <i>Pelts</i> or <i>Leather</i>, <i>Ball-Nails</i> or <i>Pumping-Nails</i>,
<i>Wool</i> or <i>Hair</i>, <i>Vellom</i> or <i>Parchment</i> or <i>Forrel</i>, the <i>Press-man</i>
generally eases the <i>Master-Printer</i> of the trouble of
choosing, though not the charge of paying for them:
And for <i>Paste</i>, <i>Sallad Oyl</i>, and such accidental Requisites
as the <i>Press-man</i> in his work may want, the <i>Devil</i>
commonly fetches for him. </p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 22. <i>Of</i> Racks <i>to Hang</i> Paper <i>on, and of the</i> Peel. </h4>

<p>Our Master-<i>Printer</i> must provide <i>Racks</i> to hang
<i>Paper</i> on to <i>Dry</i>. They are made of Deal-board Battens,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>
square, an Inch thick, and an Inch and an half deep,
and the length the whole length of the Deal, which
is commonly about ten or eleven Foot long, or else
so long as the convenience of the Room will allow:
The two upper corners of these <i>Rails</i> are rounded
off that they may not mark the <i>Paper</i>. </p>

<p>These <i>Racks</i> are Hung over Head, either in the
<i>Printing-House</i>, or <i>Ware-house</i>, or both, or any other
Room that is most convenient to <i>Dry Paper</i> in; they
are hung athwart two <i>Rails</i> an Inch thick, and about
three or four Inches deep, which <i>Rails</i> are fastned to
some Joysts or other Timber in the Ceiling by Stiles
perpendicular to the Ceiling; These <i>Rails</i> stand
so wide assunder, that each end of the <i>Racks</i> may
hang beyond them about the distance of two Foot,
and have on their upper edge at ten Inches distance
from one another, so many square Notches cut into
them as the whole length of the <i>Rail</i> will bear; Into
these square notches the <i>Racks</i> are laid parallel to
each other with the flat side downwards, and the
Rounded off side upwards. </p>

<p>The <i>Peel</i> is described in Plate 9. at l, which Figure
sufficiently shews what it is; And therefore I
shall need say no more to it, only its Handle may be
longer or shorter according as the height of the Room
it is to be used in may require. </p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 23. <i>Of</i> Inck.</h4>

<p>The providing of good <i>Inck</i>, or rather good <i>Varnish</i>
for <i>Inck</i>, is none of the least incumbent cares upon
our <i>Master-Printer</i>, though Custom has almost
made it so here in <i>England</i>; for the process of making
<i>Inck</i> being as well laborious to the Body, as noysom

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>

and ungrateful to the Sence, and by several odd
accidents dangerous of Firing the Place it is made
in, Our <i>English Master-Printers</i> do generally discharge
themselves of that trouble; and instead of having
good <i>Inck</i>, content themselves that they pay an <i>Inck-maker</i>
for good <i>Inck</i>, which may yet be better or
worse according to the Conscience of the <i>Inck-maker</i>. </p>

<p>That our Neighbours the <i>Hollanders</i> who exhibit
Patterns of good <i>Printing</i> to all the World, are careful
and industrious in all the circumstances of good
<i>Printing</i>, is very notorious to all Book-men; yet
should they content themselves with such <i>Inck</i> as we
do, their Work would appear notwithstanding the other
circumstances they observe, far less graceful
than it does, as well as ours would appear more
beautiful if we used such <i>Inck</i> as they do: for there
is many Reasons, considering how the <i>Inck</i> is made
with us and with them, why their <i>Inck</i> must needs
be better than ours. As <i>First</i>, They make theirs all
of good old <i>Linseed-Oyl</i> alone, and perhaps a little <i>Rosin</i>
in it sometimes, when as our <i>Inck-makers</i> to save
charges mingle many times <i>Trane-Oyl</i> among theirs,
and a great deal of <i>Rosin</i>; which <i>Trane-Oyl</i> by its grossness,
Furs and Choaks up a <i>Form</i>, and by its fatness
hinders the <i>Inck</i> from drying; so that when the Work
comes to the <i>Binders</i>, it <i>Sets off</i>; and besides is dull,
smeary and unpleasant to the Eye. And the <i>Rosin</i> if
too great a quantity be put in, and the <i>Form</i> be not
very <i>Lean Beaten</i>, makes the <i>Inck</i> turn yellow: And
the same does New <i>Linseed-Oyl</i>. </p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, They seldom <i>Boyl</i> or <i>Burn</i> it to that consistence
the <i>Hollanders</i> do, because they not only save
labour and Fewel, but have a greater weight of <i>Inck</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
out of the same quantity of <i>Oyl</i> when less <i>Burnt</i> away
than when more <i>Burnt</i> away; which want of
Burning makes the <i>Inck</i> also, though made of good
old <i>Linseed-Oyl</i> Fat and Smeary, and hinders its <i>Drying</i>;
so that when it comes to the <i>Binders</i> it also <i>Sets off</i>. </p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, They do not use that way of clearing
their <i>Inck</i> the <i>Hollanders</i> do, or indeed any other way
than meer Burning it, whereby the <i>Inck</i> remains
more <i>Oyly</i> and <i>Greasie</i> than if it were well clarified. </p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, They to save the <i>Press-man</i> the labour of
<i>Rubbing</i> the <i>Blacking</i> into <i>Varnish</i> on the <i>Inck-Block</i>,
<i>Boyl</i> the <i>Blacking</i> in the <i>Varnish</i>, or at least put the
<i>Blacking</i> in whilst the <i>Varnish</i> is yet <i>Boyling-hot</i>, which
so <i>Burns</i> and <i>Rubifies</i> the <i>Blacking</i>, that it loses much
of its brisk and vivid black complexion.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, Because <i>Blacking</i> is dear, and adds little to
the weight of <i>Inck</i>, they stint themselves to a quantity
which they exceed not; so that sometimes the
<i>Inck</i> proves so unsufferable <i>Pale</i>, that the <i>Press-man</i> is
forc’d to <i>Rub</i> in more <i>Blacking</i> upon the <i>Block</i>; yet
this he is often so loth to do, that he will rather hazard
the content the Colour shall give, than take the
pains to amend it: satisfying himself that he can
lay the blame upon the <i>Inck-maker</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus hinted at the difference between the
<i>Dutch</i> and <i>English Inck</i>, I shall now give you the Receipt
and manner of making the <i>Dutch-Varnish</i>.</p>

<p>They provide a <i>Kettle</i> or a <i>Caldron</i>, but a <i>Caldron</i>
is more proper, such an one as is described in Plate
9. at m. This Vessel should hold twice so much <i>Oyl</i>
as they intend to <i>Boyl</i>, that the <i>Scum</i> may be some
considerable time a <i>Rising</i> from the top of the <i>Oyl</i> to
the top of the Vessel to prevent danger. This <i>Caldron</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>

hath a Copper Cover to fit the Mouth of it,
and this Cover hath an Handle at the top of it to
take it off and put it on by. This <i>Caldron</i> is set upon
a good strong Iron <i>Trevet</i>, and fill’d half full of old
<i>Linseed-Oyl</i>, the older the better, and hath a good
Fire made under it of solid matter, either <i>Sea Coal</i>,
<i>Charcoal</i> or pretty big Chumps of Wood that will
burn well without much Flame; for should the Flame
rise too high, and the <i>Oyl</i> be very hot at the taking
off the Cover of the <i>Caldron</i>, the fume of the <i>Oyl</i>
might be apt to take Fire at the Flame, and endanger
the loss of the <i>Oyl</i> and Firing the House: Thus they
let <i>Oyl</i> heat in the <i>Caldron</i> till they think it is
Boyling-hot; which to know, they peel the outer
Films of an <i>Oynion</i> off it, and prick the <i>Oynion</i>
fast upon the end of a small long Stick, and so
put it into the heating <i>Oyl</i>: If it be Boyling-hot,
or almost Boyling-hot, the <i>Oynion</i> will put the
<i>Oyl</i> into a Fermentation, so that a Scum will gather
on the top of the <i>Oyl</i>, and rise by degrees, and that
more or less according as it is more or less Hot: But
if it be so very Hot that the Scum rises apace, they
quickly take the <i>Oynion</i> out, and by degrees the Scum
will fall. But if the <i>Oyl</i> be Hot enough, and they
intend to put any <i>Rosin</i> in, the quantity is to every
Gallon of <i>Oyl</i> half a Pound, or rarely a whole Pound.
The <i>Rosin</i> they beat small in a <i>Mortar</i>, and with an
Iron Ladle, or else by an Handful at a time strew it
in gently into the <i>Oyl</i> lest it make the Scum rise too
fast; but every Ladle-full or Handful they put in so
leasurely after one another, that the first must be
wholly dissolv’d before they put any more in; for
else the Scum will Rise too fast, as aforesaid: So that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>

you may perceive a great care is to keep the Scum
down: For if it Boyl over into the Fire never so little,
the whole Body of <i>Oyl</i> will take Fire immediately.</p>

<p>If the <i>Oyl</i> be Hot enough to <i>Burn</i>, they <i>Burn</i> it,
and that so often till it be <i>Hard</i> enough, which sometimes
is six, seven, eight times, or more.</p>

<p>To <i>Burn</i> it they take a long small Stick, or double up
half a Sheet of Paper, and light one end to set Fire to
the <i>Oyl</i>; It will presently Take if the <i>Oyl</i> be Hot
enough, if not, they Boyl it longer, till it be.</p>

<p>To try if it be <i>Hard</i> enough, they put the end of
a Stick into the <i>Oyl</i>, which will lick up about three or
four drops, which they put upon an Oyster-shell, or
some such thing, and set it by to cool, and when it is
cold they touch it with their Fore or Middle-Finger
and Thumb, and try its consistence by sticking together
of their Finger and Thumb; for if it draw stiff
like strong <i>Turpentine</i> it is Hard enough, if not, they
Boyl it longer, or <i>Burn</i> it again till it be so consolidated.</p>

<p>When it is well Boyled they throw in an Ounce of
Letharge of Silver to every four Gallons of <i>Oyl</i> to Clarifie
it, and Boyl it gently once again, and then take
it off the Fire to stand and cool, and when it is cool
enough to put their Hand in, they Strain it through
a Linnen Cloath, and with their Hands wring all the
<i>Varnish</i> out into a Leaded Stone Pot or Pan, and keeping
it covered, set it by for their use; The longer
it stands by the better, because it is less subject to
turn Yellow on the Paper that is Printed with it.</p>

<p>This is the <i>Dutch</i> way of making <i>Varnish</i>, and the
way the English <i>Inck-makers</i> ought to use.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>, <i>First</i>, That the <i>Varnish</i> may be made without
<i>Burning</i> the <i>Oyl</i>, <i>viz.</i> only with well and long

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>

Boyling it; for <i>Burning</i> is but a violent way of Boyling, to
consolidate it the sooner.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That an <i>Apple</i> or a <i>Crust</i> of <i>Bread</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> stuck upon
the end of a Stick instead of an <i>Oynion</i> will also make the
Scum of the <i>Oyl</i> rise: For it is only the Air contained in the
Pores of the <i>Apple</i>, <i>Crust</i> or <i>Oynion</i>, &amp;c. pressed or forced out
by the violent heat of the <i>Oyl</i>, that raises the many Bubbles
on the top of the <i>Oyl</i>: And the connection of those Bubbles
are vulgarly called <i>Scum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, The English <i>Inck-makers</i> that often make <i>Inck</i>, and
that in great quantities, because one Man may serve all <i>England</i>,
instead of setting a <i>Caldron</i> on a <i>Trevet</i>, build a <i>Furnace</i>
under a great <i>Caldron</i>, and Trim it about so with Brick, that it
Boyls far sooner and more securely than on a <i>Trevet</i>; because
if the <i>Oyl</i> should chance to Boyl over, yet can it not
run into the Fire, being Fenced round about with Brick as aforesaid,
and the <i>Stoking-hole</i> lying far under the <i>Caldron</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, When for want of a <i>Caldron</i> the <i>Master-Printer</i>
makes <i>Varnish</i> in a <i>Kettle</i>, He provides a great piece of thick
<i>Canvass</i>, big enough when three or four double to cover the
<i>Kettle</i>, and also to hang half round the sides of the <i>Kettle</i>: This
<i>Canvass</i> (to make it more soluble) is wet in Water, and the
Water well wrung out again, so that the <i>Canvass</i> remains
only moist: Its use is to throw flat over the Mouth of the
<i>Kettle</i> when the <i>Oyl</i> is <i>Burning</i>, to keep the smoak in, that it
may stifle the Flame when they see cause to put it out. But
the Water as was said before, must be very well wrung out of
the <i>Canvass</i>, for should but a drop or two fall from the sides of
it into the <i>Oyl</i> when it is Burning, it will so enrage the <i>Oyl</i>,
and raise the Scum, that it might endanger the working over</p>
the top of the <i>Kettle</i>.

<br>

<p>Having shewn you the <i>Master-Printers</i> Office, I account it
suitable to proper Method, to let you know how the <i>Letter-Founder</i>
Cuts the <i>Punches</i>, how the <i>Molds</i> are made, the <i>Matrices</i>
Sunck, and the <i>Letter Cast</i> and <i>Drest</i>, for all these Operations
precede the <i>Compositers</i> Trade, as the <i>Compositers</i> does the <i>Press-mans</i>;
wherefore the next <i>Exercises</i> shall be (God willing)
upon <i>Cutting</i> of the <i>Steel-Punches</i>.</p>

<h3>§. 12. ¶. 1. <i>Of Letter-Cutters Tools.</i></h3>

<p>The making of <i>Steel-Punches</i> is a Branch of
the <i>Smith</i>’s Trade: For, as I told you in the
Preface to <i>Numb.</i> 1. The <i>Black-Smith</i>’s Trade comprehends
all Trades that use either Forge or File,
from the <i>Anchor-Smith</i>, to the <i>Watch-maker</i>: They
all working by the same Rules, though not with
equal exactness; and all using the same Tools,
though of different Sizes from those the Common
<i>Black-Smith</i> uses; and that according to the various
purposes they are applied, <i>&amp;c.</i> Therefore, indeed,
a <i>Letter-Cutter</i> should have a Forge set up, as by
<i>Numb.</i> 1. But some <i>Letter-Cutters</i> may seem to scorn
to use a Forge, as accounting it too hard Labour,
and Ungenteel for themselves to officiate at. Yet
they all well know, that though they may have a
common <i>Black-Smith</i> perform their much and heavy
Work, that many times a Forge of their own at
Hand would be very commodious for them in several
accidental little and light Jobs, which (in a Train
of Work) they must meet withal.</p>

<p>But if our <i>Letter-Cutter</i> will have no Forge, yet
he must of necessity accommodate himself with a
<i>Vice</i>, <i>Hand-Vice</i>, <i>Hammers</i>, <i>Files</i>, <i>Small</i> and <i>Fine
Files</i> (commonly called <i>Watch-makers Files</i>) of these
he saves all, as they wear out, to smooth and burnish
the Sides and Face of his Letter with, as shall
be shewed; <i>Gravers</i>, and <i>Sculpters</i> of all sorts, an
<i>Anvil</i>, or a <i>Stake</i>, an <i>Oyl-stone</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> And of these,
such as are suitable and sizable to the several Letters

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>

he is to Cut. These, or many of these Tools, being
described in <i>Numb.</i> 1. I refer my Reader thither,
and proceed to give an account of some Tools peculiar
to the <i>Letter-Cutter</i>, though not of particular
use to the Common <i>Black-Smith</i>.</p>

<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of the</i> Using-File.</h4>

<p>This <i>File</i> is about nine or ten Inches long, and
three or four Inches broad, and three quarters of
an Inch thick: The two broad sides must be exactly
flat and straight: And the one side is commonly
cut with a <i>Bastard-Cut</i>, the other with a <i>Fine</i> or
<i>Smooth Cut</i>. (See <i>Numb.</i> 1. <i>Fol.</i> 14, 15.) Its use is
to <i>Rub</i> a piece of Steel, Iron, or Brass, <i>&amp;c.</i> flat and
straight upon, as shall be shewed hereafter.</p>

<p>In chusing it, you must see it be exactly Flat and
Straight all its Length and Breadth: For if it in any
part Belly out, or be Hollow inwards, what is Rubbed
upon it will be Hollow, Rubbing on the Bellying
part; and Bellying, Rubbing on the Hollow
part. You must also see that it be very Hard; and
therefore the thickest <i>Using-Files</i> are likeliest to
prove best, because the thin commonly Warp in
Hardning.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of the</i> Flat-Gage.</h4>

<p>The <i>Flat-Gage</i> is described in <i>Plate</i> 10. at A. It
is made of a flat piece of Box, or other Hard Wood.
Its Length is three Inches and an half, its Breadth two
Inches and an half, and its Thickness one Inch and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>

an half. This is on the Flat, first made Square, but
afterwards hath one of its Corners (as <i>h</i>) a little
rounded off, that it may the easier comply with
the Ball of the Hand. Out of one of its longest
Sides, <i>viz.</i> that not rounded off, is Cut through the
thickness of it an exact Square, whose one side <i>b f</i>,
<i>c g</i> is about an Inch and three quarters long; and
its other side <i>b d</i>, <i>c e</i> about half an Inch long. The
Depth of these Sides and their Angle is exactly Square
to the top and bottom of the upper and under Superficies
of the <i>Flat-Gage</i>.</p>

<p>Its Use is to hold a Rod of Steel, or Body of a <i>Mold</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> exactly perpendicular to the Flat of the <i>Using-File</i>,
that the end of it may rub upon the <i>Using-File</i>,
and be Filed away exactly Square, and that to the
Shank; as shall more at large be shewed in §. 2. ¶. 3.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of the</i> Sliding-Gage.</h4>

<p>The <i>Sliding-Gage</i> is described in <i>Plate</i> 10. at <i>Fig.</i>
B. It is a Tool commonly used by <i>Mathematical
Instrument-Makers</i>, and I have found it of great use
in <i>Letter-Cutting</i>, and making of <i>Molds</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>a a</i> the
Beam, <i>b</i> the Tooth, <i>c c</i> the Sliding Socket, <i>d d d d</i>
the Shoulder of the Socket.</p>

<p>Its Use is to measure and set off Distances between
the Sholder and the Tooth, and to mark it off from
the end, or else from the edge of your Work.</p>

<p>I always use two or three of these <i>Gages</i>, that I
need not remove the Sholder when it is set to a Distance
which I may have after-use for; as shall in
Working be shewed more fully.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Of the</i> Face-Gages, <i>marked</i> C <i>in Plate 10.</i></h4>

<p>The <i>Face-Gage</i> is a Square Notch cut with a File
into the edge of a thin Plate of Steel, Iron, or Brass,
the thickness of a piece of common Latton, and the
Notch about an <i>English</i> deep. There be three of
these Gages made, for the Letters to be cut on one
Body; but they may be all made upon one thin Plate,
the readier to be found, as at D. As first, for the Long
Letters; Secondly, for the Assending Letters; And
Thirdly, for the Short-Letters. The Length of these
several Notches, or Gages, have their Proportions
to the Body they are cut to, and are as follows. We
shall imagine (for in Practice it cannot well be perform’d,
unless in very large Bodies) that the Length
of the whole Body is divided into forty and two
equal Parts.</p>

<p>The <i>Gage</i> for the Long-Letters are the length of
the whole Body, <i>viz.</i> forty and two equal Parts.
The <i>Gage</i> for the Assending Letters, <i>Roman</i> and <i>Italica</i>,
are five Seventh Parts of the Body, <i>viz.</i> thirty
Parts of forty-two, and thirty and three Parts for
<i>English</i> Face. The <i>Gage</i> for the Short-Letters are
three Seventh Parts of the whole Body, <i>viz.</i> eighteen
Parts of forty-two for the <i>Roman</i> and <i>Italica</i>, and
twenty two Parts for the <i>English</i> Face.</p>

<p>It may indeed be thought impossible to divide a
Body into seven equal Parts, and much more difficult
to divide each of those seven equal Parts into
six equal Parts, which are forty-two, as aforesaid,
especially if the Body be but small; but yet it is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>

possible with curious Working: For seven thin Spaces
may be Cast and Rubb’d to do it. And for dividing
each of the thin Spaces into six equal Parts,
you may Cast and Rub Full Point . to be of the
thickness of one thin Space, and one sixth part of a
thin Space: And you may Cast and Rub : to be
the thickness of one thin Space, and two sixth parts
of a thin Space: And you may Cast and Rub , to
be the thickness of one thin Space, and three sixth
parts of a thin Space: And you may Cast and Rub
- to be the thickness of one thin Space, and four
sixth parts of a thin Space: And you may Cast and
Rub ; to be the thickness of one thin Space, and
five sixth parts of a thin Space.</p>

<p>The reason why I propose . to be Cast and
Rubb’d one sixth part thicker than a thin Space, is
only that it may be readily distinguished from : , - ;
which are two sixth parts, three sixth parts, four
sixth parts, five sixth parts thicker than a thin Space.
And for six sixth parts thicker than a thin Space, two
thin Spaces does it.</p>

<p>The manner of adjusting these several Sixth Parts
of Thicknesses is as follows. You may try if six .
exactly agree, and be even with seven thin Spaces;
(or, which is all one, a Body) for then is each of
those six . one sixth part thicker than a thin Space,
because it drives out a thin Space in six thin Spaces.
And you may try if six : be equal to a Body and
one thin Space; for then is each : two sixth parts
thicker than a thin Space. If six , be equal to
nine thin Spaces, then each , is three sixth parts
of a thin Space thicker than a thin Space. If six -

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>

be equal to ten thin Spaces, then each - is four
sixth parts of a thin Space thicker than a thin Space.
If six ; be equal to eleven thin Spaces, then each
; is five sixth parts of a thin Space thicker than a
thin Space.</p>

<p>Now, as aforesaid, a thin Space being one seventh
part of the Body, and the thin Space thus divided,
you have the whole Body actually divided
into forty and two equal parts, as I have divided
them in my Drafts of Letters down the Sides, and
in the Bottom-Line.</p>

<p>Though I have thus shewed how to divide a thin
Space into six equal Parts, yet when the Letter to
be Cut proves of a small Body, the thin Space divided
into two equal Parts may serve: If it prove
bigger, into three or four equal Parts: And of the
largest Bodies, they may be divided into six, as
aforesaid.</p>

<p>If now you would make a <i>Gage</i> for any number
of thin Spaces and Sixth Parts of a thin Space, you
must take one thin Space less than the number of
thin Spaces proposed, and add . : , - ; according
as the number of sixth Parts of a thin Space require;
and to those complicated Thicknesses you may file
a square Notch on the edge of the thin Plate aforesaid,
which shall be a standing Gage or Measure for
that number of thin Spaces and sixth Parts of a thin
Space.</p>

<p>All the Exception against this way of Measuring
is, that thin Spaces cast in Metal may be subject to
bow, and so their Thicknesses may prove deceitful.
But, in Answer to that, I say, you may, if you will,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>

Cast I for two thin Spaces thick, e for three
thin Spaces thick, S for four thin Spaces thick,
L for five thin Spaces thick, D for six thin Spaces
thick, or any other Letters near these several
Thicknesses, as you think fit; only remember, or
rather, make a Table of the number of thin Spaces
that each Letter on the Shank is Cast for. And by
complicating the Letters and Points, as aforesaid,
you will have any Thickness, either to make a Gage
by, or to use otherwise.</p>

<p>On the other Edge of the <i>Face-Gage</i> you may file
three other Notches, of the same Width with those
on the former Edge, for the Long, the Assending,
and Short-Letters. But though the two sides of
each of these Notches are parallel to each other, yet
is not the third side square to them, but hath the
same Slope the <i>Italick</i> hath from the <i>Roman</i>; as you
may see in the Figure at <i>b b b</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 6. <i>Of</i> Italick, <i>and other</i> Standing Gages.</h4>

<p>These <i>Gages</i> are to measure (as aforesaid) the
Slope of the <i>Italick</i> Stems, by applying the Top and
Bottom of the <i>Gage</i> to the Top and Bottom Lines
of the Letters, and the other Side of the <i>Gage</i> to
the Stem: for when the Letter complies with these
three sides of the <i>Gage</i> that Letter hath its true
Slope.</p>

<p>The manner of making these <i>Gages</i> (and indeed
all other <i>Angular Gages</i>) is thus.</p>

<p>Place one Point of a Pair of Steel <i>Dividers</i> upon
the thin Plate aforesaid, at the Point <i>c</i> or <i>d</i> (in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>

<i>Fig.</i> D in <i>Plate</i> 10.) and with the other Point describe
a small fine Arch of a Circle; as, <i>e f</i> or <i>g h</i>.
In this Arch of the Circle must be set off on the <i>Gage</i>
<i>a</i> 110 Degrees, and on the <i>Gage</i> <i>b</i> 70 Degrees,
and draw from the Centres <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> two straight
Lines through those numbers of Degrees: Then
Filing away the Plate between the two Lines, the
<i>Gages</i> are finished.</p>

<p>To find the Measure of this, or any other number
of Degrees, do thus; Describe a Circle on a
piece of Plate-Brass of any Radius (but the larger
the better) draw a straight Line exactly through
the Centre of this Circle, and another straight Line
to cut this straight Line at right Angles in the Centre,
through the Circle; so shall the Circle be divided
into four Quadrants: Then fix one Foot of your
Compasses (being yet unstirr’d) in one of the Points
where any of the straight Lines cuts the Circle, and
extend the moving Foot of your Compasses where
it will fall in the Circle, and make there a Mark,
which is 60 Degrees from the fixed Foot of the
Compasses: Then fix again one Foot of your Compasses
in the Intersection of the straight Line and
Circle that is next the Mark that was made before,
and extend the moving Foot in the same Quadrant
towards the straight Line where you first pitch’d the
Foot of your Compasses, and with the moving Foot
make another Mark in the Circle. These two Marks
divide the Quadrant into three equal Parts: The same
way you may divide the other three Quadrants; so
shall the whole Circle be divided into twelve equal
Parts; and each of these twelve equal parts contain

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>

an Arch of thirty Degrees: Then with your
Dividers divide each of these 30 Degrees into three
equal Parts, and each of these three equal Parts into
two equal Parts, and each of these two equal Parts
into five equal Parts, so shall the Circle be divided
into 360 equal Parts, for your use.</p>

<p>To use it, describe on the Centre of the Circle an
Arch of almost a Semi-Circle: This Arch must be
exactly of the same Radius with that I prescribed to
be made on the <i>Gages</i> <i>a b</i>, from <i>e</i> to <i>f</i> and from <i>g</i>
to <i>h</i>; then count in your Circle of Degrees from
any Diametral Line 110 Degrees; and laying a
straight Ruler on the Centre, and on the 110 Degrees
aforesaid, make a small Mark through the
small Arch; and placing one Foot of your Compasses
at the Intersection of the small Arch, with the
Diametral Line, open the other Foot to the Mark
made on the small Arch for 110 Degrees, and transfer
that Distance to the small Arch made on the
<i>Gage</i>: Then through the Marks that the two Points
of your Compasses make in the small Arch on the
<i>Gage</i>, draw two straight Lines from the Centre <i>c</i>:
and the Brass between those two straight Lines being
filed away, that <i>Gage</i> is made. In like manner
you may set off any other number of Degrees, for
the making of any other <i>Gage</i>.</p>

<p>In like manner, you may measure any Angle in
the Drafts of Letters, by describing a small Arch on
the Angular Point, and an Arch of the same Radius
on the Centre of your divided Circle: For then,
placing one Foot of your Compasses at the Intersection
of the small Arch with either of the straight

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>

Lines proceeding from the Angle in the Draft, and
extending the other Foot to the Intersection of the
small Arch, with the other straight Line that proceeds
from the Angle, you have between the Feet of
your Compasses, the Width of the Angle; and
by placing one Foot of your Compasses at the Intersection
of any of the straight Lines that proceed
from the Centre of the divided Circle, and the small
Arch you made on it, and making a Mark where the
other Foot of your Compasses falls in the said small
Arch, you may, by a straight Ruler laid on the
Centre of the divided Circle, and the Mark on the
small Arch, see in the Limb of the Circle the number
of Degrees contained between the Diametral,
or straight Line and the Mark.</p>

<p>If you have already a dividing-Plate of 360 Degrees,
of a larger Radius than the Arch on your
<i>Gage</i>, you may save your self the labour of dividing
a Circle (as aforesaid,) and work by your dividing-Plate
as you were directed to do with the Circle
that I shewed you to divide.</p>

<p>In these Documents I have exposed my self to a
double Censure; First, of <i>Geometricians</i>: Secondly,
of <i>Letter-Cutters</i>. <i>Geometricians</i> will censure me for
writing anew that which almost every young Beginner
knows: And <i>Letter-Cutters</i> will censure me for
proposing a Rule for that which they dare pretend
they can do without Rule.</p>

<p>To the <i>Geometricians</i> I cross the Cudgels: yet I
writ this not to them; and I doubt I have written
superfluously to <i>Letter-Cutters</i>, because I think few of
them either will or care to take pains to understand

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>

these small Rudiments of <i>Geometry</i>. If they do, and
be ingenious, they will thank me for discovering this
Help in their own Way, which few of them know.
For by this Rule they will not only make Letters
truer, but also quicker, and with less care; because
they shall never need to stamp their <i>Counter-Punch</i>
in Lead, to see how it pleases them; which they
do many times, before they like their <i>Counter-Punch</i>,
(be it of A <i>A</i> V v W w <i>V</i> <i>W</i>, and several other Letters)
and at last finish their <i>Counter-Punch</i> but with
a good Opinion they have that it may do well,
though they frequently see it does not in many Angular
Letters on different Bodies Cut by the same
Hand. And were <i>Letter-Cutting</i> brought to so common
Practice as <i>Joynery</i>, <i>Cabinet-making</i>, or <i>Mathematical
Instrument-making</i>, every young Beginner
should then be taught by Rules, as they of these
Trades are; because <i>Letter-Cutting</i> depends as much
upon Rule and Compass as any other Trade does.</p>

<p>You may in other places, where you find most
Convenience (as at <i>i</i>) make a Square, which may
stand you in stead for the Squaring the Face and
Stems of the <i>Punch</i> in <i>Roman</i> Letters, and also in
many other Uses.</p>

<p>And you may make <i>Gages</i>, as you were taught
before to try the <i>Counter-Punches</i> of Angular Letters;
as, A K M N V X Y Z, <i>Romans</i> and <i>Italicks</i>, <i>Capitals</i>
and <i>Lower-Case</i>. But then, that you may know
each distinct <i>Gage</i>, you may engrave on the several
respective <i>Gages</i>, at the Angle, A <i>A</i> 4 <i>&amp;c.</i> For by
examining by the Drafts of Letters, what Angle
their Insides make, you may set that Angle off, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>

make the <i>Gage</i> as you were taught before, in the
<i>Gage</i> for the Slope of <i>Italicks</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 7. <i>Of the</i> Liner.</h4>

<p>The <i>Liner</i> is marked E in <i>Plate</i> 10. It is a thin
Plate of Iron or Brass, whose Draft is sufficient to
express the Shape. The Use of it is on the under-edge
<i>a b</i> (which is about three Inches long) and is
made truly straight, and pretty sharp or fine; that
being applied to the Face of a <i>Punch</i>, or other piece
of Work, it may shew whether it be straight or no.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 8. <i>Of the</i> Flat-Table.</h4>

<p>The <i>Flat-Table</i> at F in <i>Plate</i> 10. The Figure is
there sufficient. All its Use is the Table F, for that
is about one Inch and an half square, and on its Superficies
exactly straight and flat. It is made of
Iron or Brass, but Brass most proper. Its Use is to
try if the Shank of a <i>Punch</i> be exactly Perpendicular
to its Face, when the Face is set upon the <i>Table</i>;
for if the Shank stand then directly upright to the
Face of the <i>Table</i>, and lean not to any side of it, it
is concluded to be perpendicular.</p>

<p>It hath several other Uses, which, when we come
to <i>Casting</i> of <i>Letters</i>, and <i>Justifying</i> of <i>Matrices</i>, shall
be shewn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 9. <i>Of the</i> Tach.</h4>

<p>The <i>Tach</i> is a piece of Hard Wood, (Box is very
good) about three Inches broad, six Inches long,
and three quarters of an Inch thick. About half its
Length is fastned firm down upon the <i>Work-Bench</i>,
and its other half projects over the hither Edge of
it. It hath three or four Angular Notches on its
Fore-end to rest and hold the Shank of a <i>Punch</i> steady
when the End of the <i>Punch</i> is screwed in the
<i>Hand-Vice</i>, and the <i>Hand-Vice</i> held in the left hand,
while the <i>Workman</i> Files or Graves on it with his
Right Hand.</p>

<p>Instead of Fastning the <i>Tach</i> to the <i>Bench</i>, I <i>Saw</i> a
square piece out of the further half of the <i>Tach</i>, that
it may not be too wide for the Chaps of the <i>Vice</i> to
take and screw that narrow End into the Chaps of
the <i>Vice</i>, because it should be less cumbersome to
my <i>Work-Bench</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 10. <i>Of Furnishing the</i> Work-Bench.</h4>

<p>The <i>Workman</i> hath all his great <i>Files</i> placed in
Leather Nooses, with their Handles upwards, that
he may readily distinguish the <i>File</i> he wants from
another <i>File</i>. These Nooses are nailed on a Board
that Cases the Wall on his Right Hand, and as near
his <i>Vice</i> as Convenience will admit, that he may the
readier take any <i>File</i> he wants.</p>

<p>He hath also on his Right Hand a Tin Pot, of
about a Pint, with small <i>Files</i> standing in it, with

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>

their Handles downwards, that their Blades may be the readier
seen. These small <i>Files</i> are called <i>Watch-makers Files</i>,
and the <i>Letter-Cutter</i> hath occasion to use these of all
Shapes, <i>viz.</i> <i>Flat</i>, <i>Pillar</i>, <i>Square</i>,
<i>Triangular</i>, <i>Round</i>, <i>Half-Round</i>, <i>Knife-Files</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>He also provides a shallow square Box, of about
five Inches long, and three Inches broad, to lay his
small Instruments in; as, his <i>Gages</i>, his <i>Liner</i>, some
common <i>Punches</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> This Box he places before
him, at the further side of the <i>Work-Bench</i>.</p>

<p>He also provides a good <i>Oyl-Stone</i>, to sharpen his
<i>Gravers</i> and <i>Sculpters</i> on. This he places at some
distance from the <i>Vice</i>, on his left hand.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 13. ¶. 1. <i>Of</i> Letter-Cutting.</h3>

<p>The <i>Letter-Cutter</i> does either Forge his <i>Steel-Punches</i>,
or procures them to be forged; as I shewed,
<i>Numb.</i> 1. <i>Fol.</i> 8, 9, 10. in <i>Vol.</i> I. <i>&amp;c.</i> But great care must
be taken, that the Steel be sound, and free from
Veins of Iron, Cracks and Flaws, which may be
discerned; as I shewed in <i>Numb.</i> 3. <i>Vol.</i> I. For if
there be any Veins of Iron in the Steel, when the
Letter is Cut and Temper’d, and you would Sink
the <i>Punch</i> into the Copper, it will batter there: Or
it will Crack or Break if there be Flaws.</p>

<p>If there be Iron in it, it must with the Chissel be
split upon a good Blood-Red-Heat in that place,
and the Iron taken or wrought out; and then with
another, or more Welding Heat, or Heats, well
doubled up, and laboured together, till the Steel
become a sound entire piece. This Operation <i>Smiths</i>
call <i>Well Currying of the Steel</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>If there be Flaws in it, you must also take good
Welding Heats, so hot, that the contiguous sides of
the Flaws may almost Run: for then, snatching it
quickly out of the Fire, you may labour it together
till it become close and sound.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Robinson</i>, a <i>Black-Smith</i> of <i>Oxford</i>, told me
a way he uses that is ingenious, and seems rational:
For if he doubts the Steel may have some small
Flaws that he can scarce discern, he takes a good
high Blood-Red Heat of it, and then twists the
Rod or Bar (as I shewed, <i>Numb.</i> 3. <i>Vol.</i> I.) which
Twisting winds the Flaws about the Body of the
Rod, and being thus equally disposed, more or less,
into the Out-sides of the Rod, according as the Position
of the Flaw may be, allows an equal Heat on
all sides to be taken, because the Out-sides heat faster
than the Inside and therefore the Out-sides of the
Steel are not thus so subject to Burn, or Run, as if it
should be kept in the Fire till the Middle, or Inside
of it should be ready to Run. And when the Steel
is thus well welded, and soundly laboured and
wrought together with proper Heats, he afterwards
reduces it to Form.</p>

<p>Now, that I may be the better understood by
my Reader as he reads further, I have, in <i>Plate</i> 10.
at <i>Fig.</i> G described the several Parts of the <i>Punch</i>;
which I here explain.</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>G The Face.</li>
<li><i>a a</i>, <i>b b</i> The Thickness.</li>
<li><i>a b</i>, <i>a b</i> The Heighth.</li>
<li><i>a c</i>, <i>b c</i>, <i>b c</i> The Length of the Shank, about an
Inch and three quarters long.</li>
<li><i>c c c</i> The Hammer-End.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>This is no strict Length for the Shank, but a convenient
Length; for should the Letter Cut on the
Face be small, and consequently, the Shank so too,
and the Shank much longer, and it (as seldom it is)
not Temper’d in the middle, it might, with Punching
into Copper, bow in the middle, either with the
weight of the Hammer, or with light reiterated
Blows: And should it be much shorter, there might
perhaps Finger-room be wanting to manage and
command it while it is Punching into the Copper.
But this Length is long enough for the biggest Letters,
and short enough for the smallest Letters.</p>

<p>The Heighth and Thickness cannot be assign’d in
general, because of the diversity of Bodies, and
Thickness of Letters: Besides, some Letters must be
Cut on a broad Face of Steel, though, when it is
Cut, it is of the same Body; as all Letters are,
to which <i>Counter-Punches</i> are used; because the
Striking the <i>Counter-Punch</i> into the Face of the
<i>Punch</i> will, if it have not strength enough to contain
it, break or crack one or more sides of the
<i>Punch</i>, and so spoil it. But if the Letter be wholly
to be Cut, and not Counter-Punch’d, as I shall hereafter
hint in general what Letters are not, then the
Face of the <i>Punch</i> need be no bigger, or, at least,
but a small matter bigger than the Letter that is to
be cut upon it.</p>

<p>Now, If the Letter be to be Counter-punch’d,
the Face of the <i>Punch</i> ought to be about twice the
Heighth, and twice the Thickness of the Face of the
<i>Counter-Punch</i>; that so, when the <i>Counter-Punch</i> is
struck just on the middle of the Face of the <i>Punch</i>, a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>

convenient Substance, and consequently, Strength
of Steel on all its Sides may be contained to resist
the Delitation, that the Sholder or Beard of the
<i>Counter-Punch</i> sinking into it, would else make.</p>

<p>If the <i>Letter-Cutter</i> be to Cut a whole Set of
<i>Punches</i> of the same Body of <i>Roman</i> and <i>Italica</i>, he
provides about 240 or 260 of these <i>Punches</i>, because
so many will be used in the <i>Roman</i> and <i>Italica</i>
<i>Capitals</i> and <i>Lower-Case</i>, <i>Double-Letters</i>, <i>Swash-Letters</i>,
<i>Accented Letters</i>, <i>Figures</i>, <i>Points</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> But this number
of <i>Punches</i> are to have several Heighths and
Thicknesses, though the Letters to be Cut on them
are all of the same Body.</p>

<p>What Heighth and Thickness is, I have shewed
before in this §, but not what Body is; therefore I
shall here explain it.</p>

<p>By Body is meant, in <i>Letter-Cutters</i>, <i>Founders</i> and
<i>Printers</i> Language, the Side of the Space contained
between the Top and Bottom Line of a Long-Letter.
As in the Draft of Letters, the divided Line on the
Left-Hand of A is divided into forty and two equal
Parts; and that Length is the Body, thus: J being
an Ascending and Descending Letter, <i>viz.</i> a long
Letter, stands upon forty-two Parts, and therefore
fills the whole Body.</p>

<p>There is in common Use here in <i>England</i>, about
eleven Bodies, as I shewed in §. 2. ¶. 2. of this Volumne.</p>

<p>I told you even now, that all the <i>Punches</i> for the
same Body must not have the same Heighth and
Thickness: For some are Long; as, J j Q, and several
others; as you may see in the Drafts of Letters:
and these Long-Letters stand upon the whole
Heighth of the Body.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>

<p>The Ascending and Descending Letters reach
from the Foot-Line, up to the Top-Line; as all the
Capital Letters are Ascending Letters, and so are
many of the Lower-Case Letters; as, b d f, and several
others. The Descending Letters are of the
same Length with the Ascending Letters; as, g p q
and several others. These are contained between
the Head-Line and the Bottom-Line. The Short
Letters are contained between the Head-Line and
the Bottom-line. These are three different Sizes of
Heighth the <i>Punches</i> are made to, for Letters of the
same Body. But in proper place I shall handle this
Subject more large and distinctly.</p>

<p>And as there is three Heighths or Sizes to be considered
in Letters Cut to the same Body, so is there
three Sizes to be considered, with respect to the
Thicknesses of all these Letters, when the <i>Punches</i>
are to be Forged: For some are m thick; by m
thick is meant m <i>Quadrat</i> thick, which is just so thick
as the Body is high: Some are n thick; that is to
say, n <i>Quadrat</i> thick, <i>viz.</i> half so thick as the Body
is high: And some are <i>Space</i> thick; that is, one
quarter so thick as the Body is high; though Spaces
are seldom Cast so thick, as shall be shewed when
we come to <i>Casting</i>: and therefore, for distinction
sake, we shall call these Spaces, Thick Spaces.</p>

<p>The first three Sizes fit exactly in Heighth to all
the Letters of the same Body; but the last three Sizes
fit not exactly in Thickness to the Letters of the
same Body; for that some few among the Capitals
are more than m thick, some less than m thick, and
more than n thick; and some less than n thick, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>

more than Space thick; yet for Forging the <i>Punches</i>,
these three Sizes are only in general Considered,
with Exception had to Æ <i>Æ</i> <i>Q</i>, and most of the
Swash-Letters; which being too thick to stand on
an m, must be Forged thicker, according to the
Workman’s Reason.</p>

<p>After the Workman has accounted the exact
number of Letters he is to Cut for one Set, he considers
what number he shall use of each of these several
Sizes in the <i>Roman</i>, and of each of these several
Sizes in the <i>Italick</i>; (for the <i>Punches</i> of <i>Romans</i>
and <i>Italicks</i>, if the Body is large, are not to be Forged
to the same shape, as shall be shewed by and by)
and makes of a piece of Wood one Pattern of the several
Sizes that he must have each number Forged
to. Upon every one of these Wooden Patterns I
use to write with a Pen and Ink the number of
<i>Punches</i> to be Forged of that Size, lest afterwards I
might be troubled with Recollections.</p>

<p>I say (for Example) He considers how many long
Letters are m thick, how many Long-Letters are n
thick, and how many Long-Letters are Space thick,
in the <i>Roman</i>; and also considers which of these
must be Counter-punch’d, and which not: For (as
was said before) those Letters that are to be Counter-punch’d
are to have about twice the Heighth and
twice the Thickness of the Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>,
for the Reason aforesaid. But the Letters not
to be Counter-punch’d need no more Substance but
what will just contain the Face of the Letter; and
makes of these three Sizes three Wooden Patterns,
of the exact Length, Heighth and Thickness that the
Steel <i>Punches</i> are to be Forged to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>He also counts how many are Ascendents and
Descendents, m thick, n thick, and Space thick;
still considering how many of them are to be Counter-punch’d,
and how many not; and makes Wooden
Patterns for them.</p>

<p>The like he does for short-letters; and makes
Wooden Patterns for them, for Steel <i>Punches</i> to be
Forged by.</p>

<p>And as he has made his Patterns for the <i>Roman</i>, so he
makes Patterns for the <i>Italick</i> Letters also; for the same
shap’d <i>Punches</i> will not serve for <i>Italick</i>, unless he
should create a great deal more Work to himself than he need do: For
<i>Italick Punches</i> are not all to be Forged with their sides
square to one another, as the <i>Romans</i> are; but only the highest
and lowest sides must stand in Line with the highest and lowest sides
of the <i>Roman</i>; but the Right and Left-Hand sides stand not
parallel to the Stems of the <i>Roman</i>, but must make an Angle of
20 Degrees with the <i>Roman</i> Stems: so that the Figure of the Face
of the <i>Punch</i> will become a <i>Rhomboides</i>, as it is called
by <i>Geometricians</i>, and the Figure of this Face is the Slope
that the <i>Italick</i> Letters have from the <i>Roman</i>, as in
proper place shall be further shewed. Now, should the <i>Punches</i>
for these Letters be Forged with each side square to one another, the
<i>Letter-Cutter</i> would be forced to spend a great deal of Time, and
take great pains to File away the superfluous Steel about the Face of
the Letter when he comes to the Finishing of it, especially in great
Bodied Letters. Yet are not all the <i>Italick</i> Letters to be Forged
on the Slope; for the <i>Punches</i> of some of them, as the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>

<i>m n</i>, and many others, may have all, or, at least,
three of their sides, square to one another, though
their Stems have the common Slope, because the
ends of their Beaks and Tails lie in the same, perpendicular
with the Outer Points of the Bottom and
Top of their Stems, as is shewed in the Drafts of
Letters.</p>

<p>Though I have treated thus much on the Forging
of Punches, yet must all what I have said be understood
only for great Bodied <i>Punches</i>; <i>viz.</i> from
the <i>Great-Primer</i>, and upwards. But for smaller Bodies;
as <i>English</i>, and downwards, the <i>Letter-Cutter</i>
generally, both for <i>Romans</i> and <i>Italicks</i>, gets so many
square Rods of Steel, Forged out of about two
or three Foot in Length, as may serve his purpose;
which Rods he elects as near his Body and Sizes as
his Judgment will serve him to do; and with the
edge of a Half-round File, or a Cold-Chissel, cuts
them into so many Lengths as he wants <i>Punches</i>.
Nay, many of these Rods may serve for some of the
small Letters in some of the greater Bodies; and also,
for many of their <i>Counter-Punches</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus prepared your <i>Punches</i>, you must
Neal them, as I shewed in <i>Numb.</i> 3. <i>Vol.</i> I.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of</i> Counter-Punches.</h4>

<p>The <i>Counter-Punches</i> for great Letters are to be
Forged as the <i>Letter-Punches</i>; but for the smaller
Letters, they may be cut out of Rods of Steel, as
aforesaid. They must also be well Neal’d, as the
<i>Punches</i>. Then must one of the ends be Filed away

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>

on the outside the Shank, to the exact shape of the
inside of the Letter you intend to Cut. For Example,
If it be <i>A</i> you would Cut; This <i>Counter-Punch</i>
is easie to make, because it is a Triangle; and
by measuring the Inside of the Angle of <i>A</i> in the
Draft of Letters, as you were taught, §. 12. ¶. 6.
you may make on your Standing <i>Gage-Plate</i> a <i>Gage</i>
for that Angle: So that, let the Letter to be Cut be
of what Body you will, from the least, to the biggest
Body, you have a Standing <i>Gage</i> for this <i>Counter-Punch</i>,
so oft as you may have occasion to Cut A.</p>

<p>The <i>Counter-Punch</i> of <i>A</i> ought to be Forged
Triangularly, especially towards the Punching End, and Tryed by the
<i>A-Gage</i>, as you were taught to use the Square, <i>Numb.</i> 3.
<i>Vol.</i> I. Yet, for this and other Triangular <i>Punches</i>,
I commonly reserve my worn- out three square Files, and make my
<i>Counter-Punch</i> of a piece of one of them that best fits the Body
I am to Cut.</p>

<p>Having by your <i>A-Gage</i> fitted the Top-Angle and
the Sides of this <i>Counter-Punch</i>, you must adjust its
Heighth by one of the three <i>Face-Gages</i> mentioned
in §. 12. ¶. 5. <i>viz.</i> by the Ascending <i>Face-Gage</i>;
for <i>A</i> is an Ascending Letter. By Adjusting, I do
not mean, you must make the <i>Counter-Punch</i> so high,
as the Depth of the Ascending <i>Face-Gage</i>; because
in this Letter here is to be considered the Top and
the Footing, which strictly, as by the large Draft
of <i>A</i>, make both together five sixth Parts of a thin
Space: Therefore five sixth Parts must be abated in
the Heighth of your <i>Counter-Punch</i>, and it must be
but four thin Spaces, and one sixth part of a thin

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>

Space high, because the Top above the <i>Counter-Punch</i>,
and the Footing below, makes five sixth Parts
of a thin Space, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Therefore, to measure off the Width of four thin
Spaces and one sixth Part of a thin Space, lay three
thin Spaces, or, which is better, the Letter e, which
is three thin Spaces, as aforesaid; and . which is
one thin Space and one sixth part of a thin Space,
upon one another; for they make together, four
thin Spaces, and one sixth part of a thin Space; and
the thickness of these two Measures shall be the
Heighth of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>, between the Footing
and the Inner Angle of <i>A</i>. And thus, by this Example,
you may couple with proper Measures either
the whole forty-two, which is the whole Body, or
any number of its Parts, as I told you before.</p>

<p>This Measure of four thin Spaces and one sixth
part of a thin Space is not a Measure, perhaps, used
more in the whole Set of Letters to be Cut to the
present Body, therefore you need not make a <i>Standing
Gage</i> for it; yet a present <i>Gage</i> you must have:
Therefore use the <i>Sliding-Gage</i> (described in §. 12.
¶. 4. and <i>Plate</i> 10. at B.) and move the Socket <i>c c</i>
on the Beam <i>a a</i>, till the Edge of the Sholder of the
Square of the Socket at the under-side of the Beam
stands just the Width of four thin Spaces and one
sixth part of a thin Space, from the Point of the
Tooth <i>b</i>; which you may do by applying the Measure
aforesaid just to the Square and Point of the
Tooth; for then if you Screw down the Screw in
the upper-side of the Sliding Socket, it will fasten
the Square at that distance from the Point of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>

Tooth. And by again applying the side of the
Square to the Foot of the Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>,
you may with the Tooth describe a small race,
which will be the exact Heighth of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>
for <i>A</i>. But <i>A</i> hath a Fine stroak within it,
reaching from Side to Side, which by the large
Draft of <i>A</i>, you may find that the middle of this
cross stroak is two Thin Spaces above the bottom
of this <i>Counter-Punch</i>; and with your common <i>Sliding-Gage</i>
measure that distance as before, and set
off that distance also on the Face of your <i>Counter-Punch</i>.
Then with the edge of a Fine <i>Knife-File</i>,
File straight down in that race, about the depth of
a Thin Space, or somewhat more; So shall the
<i>Counter-Punch</i> for <i>A</i> be finisht. But you may if you
will, take off the Edges or Sholder round about
the Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>, almost so deep as
you intend to strike it into the <i>Punch</i>: for then the
Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i> being Filed more to a Point,
will easier enter the <i>Punch</i> than the broad Flat-Face.

But note, That if it be a very Small Bodied <i>A</i>
you would make, the Edge of a Thin <i>Knife-File</i>
may make too wide a Groove: In this case you
must take a peece of a well-Temper’d broken Knife,
and strike its Edge into the Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>,
as aforesaid.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of Sinking the</i> Counter-Punches.</h4>

<p>Having thus finisht his <i>Counter-Punch</i>, he Hardens
and Tempers it, as was taught <i>Numb.</i> 3. <i>fol.</i> 57, 58.
<i>Vol.</i> I. And having also Filed the Face of his Punch

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>

he intends to cut his <i>A</i> upon, pretty Flat by guess,
he Screws the Punch upright, and hard into the
Vice: And setting the Face of his <i>Counter-Punch</i> as
exactly as he can, on the middle of the Face of his
Punch, he, with an Hammer suitable to the Size of
his <i>Counter-Punch</i>, strikes upon the end of the
<i>Counter-Punch</i> till he have driven the Face of it
about two Thin Spaces deep into the Face of the
Punch. So shall the <i>Counter-Punch</i> have done its Office.</p>

<p>But if the Letter to be <i>Counter-Puncht</i> be large,
as <i>Great-Primmer</i>, or upwards, I take a good high
Blood-red Heat of it, and Screw it quickly into the
Vice; And having my <i>Counter-Punch</i> Hard, not
Temper’d, because the Heat of the Punch softens
it too fast: And also having before-hand the <i>Counter-Punch</i>
Screwed into the <i>Hand-Vice</i> with its Shank
along the Chaps, I place the Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>
as before, on the middle of the Face of the Punch,
and with an Hammer drive it in, as before.</p>

<p>Taking the Punch out of the Vice, he goes about
to Flat and Smoothen the Face in earnest; for it
had been to no purpose to Flat and Smoothen it exactly
before, because the Sinking of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>
into it, would have put it out of Flat again.</p>

<p>But before he Flats and Smoothens the Face of
the Punch, He Files by guess the superfluous Steel
away about the Face of the Letter, <i>viz.</i> so much,
or near so much, as is not to be used when he comes
to finish up the Letter, as in this present Letter <i>A</i>,
which standing upon a Square Face on the Punch,
meets in an Angle at the Top of the Letter. Therefore
the Sides of that Square must be Filed away

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>

to an Angle at the Top of the Face of the Punch. But
great care must be taken, that he Files not more away
than he should: For he considers that the left-hand
Stroak of <i>A</i> is a Fat Stroak, and that both the
left-hand and the right-hand Stroak too, have Footings,
which he is careful to leave Steel enough in
their proper places for.</p>

<p>The reason why these are now Fil’d thus away,
and not after the Letter is finisht, is, Because in the
Flatting the Face there is now a less Body of Steel
to File away, than if the whole Face of the Punch
had remain’d intire: For though the following ways
are quick ways to Flatten the Face, yet considering
how tenderly you go to Work, and with what
Smooth Files this Work must be done, the riddance
made will be far less when a broad Face of <i>Steel</i> is
to be Flatned, than when only so much, or very
little more than the Face of the <i>Letter</i> only is to be
Flatned.</p>

<p>To Flat and Smoothen the Face of the Punch,
he uses the <i>Flat-Gage</i>, (described §. 12. ¶. 3. and
<i>Plate</i> 10. at A.) thus, He fits one convex corner of
the Shank of the Punch, into the Concave corner
of the <i>Flat-Gage</i>, and so applies his <i>Flat-Gage-Punch</i>
and all to the Face of the <i>Using-File</i>, and
lets the <i>Counter-Puncht</i> end, <i>viz.</i> the Face of the
Punch Sink down to the Face of the <i>Using-File</i>:
And then keeping the convex Corner of the Shank
of the Punch close and steddy against the Concave
corner of the <i>Flat-Gage</i>, and pressing with one of his
Fingers upon the then upper end of the Punch, <i>viz.</i>
the Hammer-end, he also at the same time, presses

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>

the lower end of the Punch, <i>viz.</i> The Face against
the <i>Using-File</i>, and thrusts the <i>Flat-Gage</i> and <i>Punch</i>
in it so oft forwards, till the extuberant Steel on
the Face, be Rub’d or Fil’d away: which he knows
partly by the alteration of colour and Fine Furrows
made by the <i>Using-File</i> on the Face of the
Punch, and partly by the falling away of the parts
of the Face that are not yet toucht by the <i>Using-File</i>:
So that it may be said to be truly Flat: which
he knows, when the whole Face of the Punch
touches upon the Flat of the <i>Using-File</i>, or at least,
so much of the Face as is required in the Letter:
For all Counter-Puncht-Letters, as aforesaid, must
have a greater Face of Steel than what the bare
Letter requires: for the reason aforesaid.</p>

<p>Another way I use is thus. After I have Fil’d the
Face as true as I can by guess, with a <i>Rough-Cut-File</i>,
I put the Punch into an Hand-Vice, whose Chaps
are exactly Flat, and straight on the upper Face, and
sink the Shank of the Punch so low down in the
Chaps of the Hand-Vice, that the low side of the
Face of the Punch may lye in the same Plain with
the Chaps; which I try with the Liner. For the
Liner will then shew if any of the Sides stand higher
than the Plain of the Chaps: Then I Screw the
Punch hard up, and File off the rising side of the
Punch, which brings the Face to an exact Level:
For the Face of the Chaps being Hard Steel, a File
cannot touch them, but only take off the aforesaid
Rising parts of the Face of the Punch, till the
<i>Smooth-File</i> has wrought it all over exactly into the
same Plain with the Face of the Chaps of the <i>Hand-Vice</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Some <i>Letter-Cutters</i> work them Flat by Hand,
which is not only difficult, but tedious, and at the
best, but done by guess.</p>

<p>The inconvenience that this Tool is subject to, is,
That with much using its Face will work out of Flat.
Therefore it becomes the Workman to examine it
often, and when he finds it faulty to mend it.</p>

<p>When they <i>File</i> it Flat by Hand, they Screw the
Shank of the Punch perpendicularly upright into
the Chaps of the Vice, and with a <i>Flat-Bastard-Cut-File</i>,
of about Four Inches long, or if the
Punch be large, the File larger, according to discretion,
and File upon the Face, as was shewn
<i>Numb.</i> I. <i>fol.</i> 15, 16. Then they take it out of the
Vice again, and holding up the Face Horizontally
between the Sight and the Light, examine by nice
observing whether none of its Angles or Sides are
too high or too low. And then Screwing it in the
Vice again, as before, with a <i>Smooth-Cut-File</i>, he at
once both Files down the Higher Sides or Angles,
and Smoothens the Face of the Punch. But yet is
not this Face so perfectly Flatned, but that perhaps
the middle of it rises more or less, above the
Sides: And then he Screws it in his <i>Hand-Vice</i>, and
leans the Shank of the Punch against the Tach,
pretty near upright, and so as he may best command
it, and with a <i>Watch-Makers Half-Round-Sharp-Cut-File</i>,
Files upon it with the Flat-Side of his File;
But so that he scarce makes his forward and backward
Stroaks longer than the breadth of the Face
of his Punch, lest in a long Stroak, the hither or
farther end of his File should Mount or Dip, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>

therefore keeps his File, with the Ball of his Finger
upon it, close to the Face of the Punch. Then with
the Liner he examines how Flat the Face of the
Punch is, and if it be not yet Flat, as perhaps it
will not be in several Trials, he again reiterates the
last process with the <i>Small-Half-Round-File</i>, till it
be Flat. But he often Files cross the Furrows of
the File, as well because it makes more riddance,
as because he may better discern how the File bears
on the Face of the Punch.</p>

<p>When it is Flat, he takes a Small well-worn
Half-Round-File, and working (as before) with the
<i>Sharp-Cut-File</i>, he Smoothens the Face of the
Punch.</p>

<p>Having thus Flatted the Face of the Punch, and
brought the Letter to some appearance of Form,
He Screws the Punch in the Hand-Vice, but not
with the Shank perpendicular to the Chaps, but so
as the Side he intends to File upon may stand upwards
and aslope too, and make an Angle with
the Chaps of the Hand-Vice. And holding the
Hand-Vice steddy in his left hand, he rests the
Shank of the Punch pretty near its Face upon the
Tach: and then with a small <i>Flat-File</i>, called a
<i>Pillar-File</i>, in his right hand, holding the Smooth
Thin Side of it towards the Footing of the Stem,
he Files that Stem pretty near its due Fatness, and
so by several reiterated proffers, lest he should File
too much of the Stem away, he brings that Stem
at last to its true Fatness. Then he measures with
the Ascending <i>Face-Gage</i>, the Heighth of the Letter:
For though the <i>Counter-Punch</i> was imagin’d

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>

(as aforesaid) to be made to an exact Heighth for
the inside of the Letter; yet with deeper or shallower
Sinking it into the <i>Punch</i>, the inside oft
proves higher or lower: Because, as aforesaid, the
Superficies of the Face of the <i>Counter-Punch</i> is less
than the true measure. But as it runs Sholdering into
the Shank of the <i>Counter-Punch</i> the Figure or
Form of the inside becomes bigger than the inside
of the Letter ought to be. Therefore the deeper
this Sholdering Shank is sunk into the Face of the
<i>Punch</i>, the higher and broader will the Form of the
inside of the Letter be, and the shallower it is
Sunk in, the Shorter and Narrower by the Rule of
Contraries.</p>

<p>He measures, as I said, with the Assending Face-Gage,
and by it finds in what good Size the Letter
is. If it be too high, as most commonly it is, because
the Footing and Top are yet left Fat, then
with several proffers he Files away the Footing and
Top, bringing the Heighth nearer and nearer still,
considering in his Judgment whether it be properest
to File away on the Top or Footing, till at last
he fits the Heighth of the Letter by the Assending
<i>Face-Gage</i>.</p>

<p>But though he have fitted the Heighth of the
Letter, yet if the <i>Counter-Punch</i> were made a little
too little, or Sunk a little too shallow, not only the
Footing will prove too Fat, but the Triangle above
the Cross-stroke of <i>A</i> will be too small; or if too
big, the Footing and part of the Top will be Filed
away, when it is brought to a due Heighth, and
then the Letter is Spoil’d, unless it be so deep Sunk,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>

that by working away the Face, as aforesaid, he
can regain the Footing and Top through the
Slope-sholdering of the <i>Counter-Punch</i>, and also keep
the inside of the Letter deep enough.</p>

<p>But if the Footing be too <i>Fat</i> or the Triangle of
the Top too little in the Inside, he uses the Knife-backt
Sculpter, and with one of the edges or both,
that proceeds from the Belly towards the Point of
the Sculpter (which edges we will for distinction
sake call <i>Angular edges</i>) he by degrees and with
several proffers Cuts away the Inside of the Footing,
or opens the Triangle at the Top or both, till
he hath made the Footing lean enough, and the
Triangle big enough.</p>

<p>But if he works on the Triangle of the Top, he
is careful not to Cut into the Straight of the Inside
lines of the Stems, but to keep the Insides of that
Triangle in a perfect straight line with the other
part of the Inside of the Stem.</p>

<p>The small arch of a Circle on the Top of <i>A</i> is
Fil’d away with a Sizable Round-File. And so for
all other Letters that have Hollows on their Outsides;
he fits himself with a small File of that shape
and Size that will fit the Hollow that he is to work
upon: For thus the Tails of Swash-Letters in Italick
Capitals are Fil’d with half-Round Files Sizable to the
Hollows of them. But I instead of Round or Half-Round
Files, in this Case, bespeak Pillar Files of several
Thicknesses, and cause the <i>File-maker</i> to Round and
Hatch the Edges: which renders the File strong and
able to endure hard leaning on, without Breaking,
which Round or Half-Round Files will not Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>I need give no more Examples of Letters that are
to be Counter-punched: And for Letters that need
neither Counter-punching or Graving, they are
made as the Out-sides of <i>A</i>, with Files proper to the
shapes of their Stroaks.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of Graving and Sculping the Insides of</i><br>
Steel Letters.</h4>

<p>The <i>Letter-Cutter</i> elects a <i>Steel Punch</i> or <i>Rod</i>, a
small matter bigger than the Size of the Letter he is
to Cut; because the Topping or Footing Stroaks
will be stronger when they are a little Bevell’d from
the Face. The Face of these Letters not being to
be Counter-punched are first Flatned and Smoothed,
as was shewed, ¶. 3. Then with the proper <i>Gage</i>,
<i>viz.</i> the Long, the Ascending, or else the Short
<i>Face-Gage</i>, according as the Letter is that he intends
to Cut, He measures off the exact Heighth of the
Letter, Thus; He first Files one of the Sides of the
Face of the <i>Punch</i> (<i>viz.</i> that Side he intends to
make the Foot of his Letter) exactly straight; which
to do, he screws his <i>Punch</i> pretty near the bottom
end, with its intended Foot-side uppermost, aslope
into one end of the Chaps of his <i>Hand-Vice</i>. So that
the Shank of the <i>Punch</i> lies over the Chaps of the
<i>Hand-Vice</i>, and makes an Angle of about 45 Degrees
with the Superficies of the Chaps of it: Then
he lays the under-side of the Shank of his <i>Punch</i> aslope
upon his <i>Tache</i>, in one of the Notches of it, that will
best fit the size of his <i>Punch</i>, to keep it steady; and
so Files the Foot-Line of the <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>But he Files not athwart the sides of his <i>Punch</i>;
for that might make the Foot-Line Roundish, by a
Mounting and Dipping the Hand is prone to; as I
shewed, <i>Vol.</i> I. <i>Fol.</i> 15, 16. But he holds his File
so as the Length of it may hang over the Length of
the Shank of the <i>Punch</i>, and dip upon it at the Face
of the <i>Punch</i>, with a Bevel, or Angle, of about 100
Degrees with the Face of the <i>Punch</i>. This Angle
you may measure with the <i>Beard-Gage</i>, described
in <i>Plate</i> 10. <i>Fig.</i> C. at <i>k</i>. Then Filing with the File
in this Position, the Foot-Line will be made a true
straight Line. But yet he examines it too by applying
the <i>Liner</i> to it; and holding the <i>Punch</i> and <i>Liner</i>
thus to the Light; If the <i>Liner</i> touches all the way
on the Foot-Line, he concludes it true; if not, he
mends it till it do.</p>

<p>Then he uses his proper <i>Steel-Gage</i>, and places the
Sholder of it against the Shank of the <i>Punch</i> at the
Foot-Line; and pressing the Sholder of the <i>Steel-Gage</i>
close against the Foot-Line, he, with the Tooth
of the <i>Gage</i> makes a Mark or Race on the side of
the Face, opposite to the Foot-line: And that Mark
or Race shall be from the Foot-Line, the Bounds of
the Heighth of that Letter.</p>

<p>Then on the Face he draws or marks the exact
shape of the Letter, with a Pen and Ink if the Letter
be large, or with a smooth blunted Point of a
Needle if it be small: Then with sizable and proper
shaped and Pointed Sculptors and Gravers, digs or
Sculps out the Steel between the Stroaks or Marks
he made on the Face of the <i>Punch</i>, and leaves the
Marks standing on the Face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>If the Letter be great he is thus to Sculp out, he
then, with a Graver, Cuts along the Insides of the
drawn or marked Stroaks, round about all the Hollow
he is Cutting-in. And having Cut about all the
sides of that Hollow, he Cuts other straight Lines
within that Hollow, close to one another (either parallel
or aslope, it matters not) till he have filled the
Hollow with straight Lines; and then again, Cuts
in the same Hollow, athwart those straight Lines,
till he fill the Hollow with Thwart Lines also.
Which straight Lines, and the Cuttings athwart
them, is only to break the Body of Steel that lies on
the Face of the <i>Punch</i> where the Hollow must be;
that so the Round-Back’d Sculptor may the easier
Cut through the Body of the Steel, in the Hollow,
on the Face of the <i>Punch</i>; even as I told you, <i>Numb.</i>
4. <i>Vol.</i> I. §. 2. the Fore-Plain makes way for the
Fine Plains.</p>

<p>The <i>Letter-Cutter</i> does not expect to perform this
Digging or Sculping at one single Operation; but,
having brought the Inside of his Letter as near as he
can at the first Operation, he, with the flat side of
a Well-worn, Small, Fine-Cut, Half-round File, Files
off the Bur that his Sculptors or Gravers made on
the Face of the Letter, that he may the better and
nicelier discern how well he has begun. Then he
again falls to work with his Sculptors and Gravers,
mending, as well as he can, the faults he finds; and
again Files off the Bur as before, and mends so oft,
till the Inside of his Letter pleases him pretty well.
But before every Mending he Files off the Bur, which
else, as aforesaid, would obscure and hide the true
shape of his Stroaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>Having well shaped the Inside Stroaks of his Letter,
he deepens the Hollows that he made, as well
as he can, with his Sculptors and Gravers: And the
deeper he makes these Hollows, the better the Letter
will prove. For if the Letters be not deep enough,
in proportion to their Width, they will, when the
Letter comes to be Printed on, Print Black, and
so that Letter is spoiled.</p>

<p>How deep these Hollows are to be, cannot be
well asserted, because their Widths are so different,
both in the same Letter, and in several Letters:
Therefore he deepens them according to his Judgment
and Reason. For Example, O must be deeper
than A need be, because the Hollow of O is wider
than the Hollow of A; A having a Cross Stroak in
it; and the wider the Hollow is, the more apt will
the wet Paper be to press deeper towards the bottom
in Printing. Yet this in General for the Depth
of Hollows; You may make them, if you can, so
deep as the <i>Counter-Punch</i> is directed to be struck
into the Face of the Punch. See ¶. 3. of this §.</p>

<p>Having with his Gravers and Sculptors deepned
them so much as he thinks convenient, he, with a
<i>Steel Punch</i>, pretty near fit to the shape and size of
the Hollow, and Flatted on its Face, Flattens down
the Irregularities that the Gravers or Sculptors made,
by striking with a proper Hammer, upon the Hammer-end
of the <i>Punch</i>, with pretty light blows. But
he takes great care, that this <i>Flat-Punch</i> be not at
all too big for the Hollow it is to be struck into, lest
it force the sides of the Stroaks of the Letter out of
their shape: And therefore also it is, that he strikes

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>

but easily, though often, upon the end of the <i>Flat-Punch</i>.</p>

<p>Having finished the Inside, he works the Outsides
with proper Files; as I shewed before, in Letter A;
and smoothens and Pollishes the Outside Stroaks
and Face with proper worn-out small <i>Watch-makers
Files</i>.</p>

<p>The Inside and Outside of the Face thus finished,
he considers what Sholdering the Shank of the <i>Punch</i>
makes now with the Face, round about the Letter.
For, as the Shank of the Letter stands farther off the
Face of any of the Stroaks, the Sholdering will be
the greater when the Letter is first made; because
the Outsides of the Letter, being only shaped at first
with Fine Small Files, which take but little Steel off,
they are Cut Obtusely from the Shank to the Face,
and the Steel of the Shank may with Rougher Files
afterwards, be Cut down more Tapering to the
Shank. For the Sholder of the Shank, as was said
before in this ¶, must not make an Angle with the
Face, of above 100 Degrees; because else they
would be, first, more difficult to Sink into Copper;
And Secondly, The broad Sholders would more or
less (when the Letter is Cast in such Matrices) and
comes to the Press, be subject, and very likely to
be-smear the Stroaks of the Letter; especially, with
an Hard Pull, and too wet Paper; which squeezes
the Face of the Letter deep into the Paper, and so
some part of the Broad Sholdering of the Letter,
receiving the Ink, and pressing deep into the Paper,
slurs the Printed Paper, and so makes the whole
Work shew very nasty and un-beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>For these Reasons it is, that the Shank of the
<i>Punch</i>, about the Face, must be Filed away (at least,
so much as is to be Sunk into Copper) pretty close
to the Face of the Letter; yet not so as to make a
Right Angle with the Face of the Letter, but an
Obtuse Angle of about 100 Degrees: For, should
the Shank be Filed away to a Right Angle, <i>viz.</i> a
Square with the Face, if any Footing or Topping be
on the Letter, these fine Stroaks will be more subject
to break when the <i>Punch</i> is Sunk into Copper,
than when the Angle of the Face and Shank is augmented;
because then those fine Stroaks stand upon
a stronger Foundation. Therefore he uses the <i>Beard-Gage</i>,
and with that examines round about the Letter,
and makes the Face and Shank comply with
that.</p>

<p>Yet Swash-Letters, especially <i>Q</i>, whose Swashes
come below the Foot-Line, and whose Length
reaches under the Foot-Line of the next Letter, or
Letters in Composing, ought to have the Upper
Sholder of that Swash Sculped down straight, <i>viz.</i>
to a Right Angle, or Square with the Face; at least,
so much of it as is to be Sunk into Copper: Because
the Upper Sholder of the Swash would else be so
broad, that it would ride upon the Face of the next
Letter. Therefore the Swash-Letters being all Long
Letters, the lower end of the Swashes reach as low
as the Bottom-Line; which cannot be Filed Square
enough down from the Head-Line, unless the Steel
the Swash stands on, should be Filed from end to
end, the length of the whole Shank of the <i>Punch</i>,
which would be very tedious; and besides, would

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>

make that part of the Shank the Swash stands on so
weak, that it would scarce endure Striking into the
Copper. Therefore, as I said before, the Upper
Sholder of the Swash ought to be Sculped down:
Yet I never heard of any <i>Letter-Cutters</i> that had the
knack of doing it; but that they only Filed it as
straight down as they could, and left the <i>Letter-Kerner</i>,
after the Letter was Cast, to Kern away
the Sholdering. Yet I use a very quick way of doing
it; which is only by Resting the Back of a Graver
at first, to make way; and afterwards a Sculptor,
upon the Shank of the <i>Punch</i>, at the end of the
Swash, one while; and another while on the Shank,
at the Head, that the Swash may be Sculped down
from end to end: and Sculping so, Sculp away
great Flakes of the Steel at once, till I have Cut it
down deep enough, and to a Right Angle.</p>

<p>Then he Hardens and Tempers the Punch; as
was shewed, <i>Numb.</i> 3. <i>Vol.</i> I. <i>Fol.</i> 57, 58.</p>

<p>But though the <i>Punch</i> be Hardned and Temper’d,
yet it is not quite finished: for, in the Hardning,
the <i>Punch</i> has contracted a Scurf upon it; which
Scurf must be taken off the Face, and so much of the
sides of the Shank as is to be Sunk into Copper. Some
<i>Letter-Cutters</i> take this Scurf off with small smooth
Files, and afterwards with fine Powder of <i>Emerick</i>.
The <i>Emerick</i> they use thus. They provide a Stick
of Wood about two Handful long, and about a
<i>Great-Primer</i>, or <i>Double-Pica</i> thick: Then in an
Oyster-shell, or any sleight Concave thing, they
powr a little Sallad-Oyl, and put Powder of <i>Emerick</i>
to it, till it become of the Consistence of Batter

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>

made for Pan-cakes. And stirring this Oyl and <i>Emerick</i>
together, spread or smear the aforesaid Stick
with the Oyl and <i>Emerick</i>, and so rub hard upon
the Face of the <i>Punch</i>, and also upon part of the
Shank, till they have taken the Scurf clean off.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walberger</i> of <i>Oxford</i> uses another way. He
makes such an Instrument as is described in <i>Plate</i> 10.
at H, which we will, for distinction sake, call the
<i>Joynt-Flat-Gage</i>. This Instrument consists of two
Cheeks about nine Inches long, as at b, and are fastned
together at one end, as the Legs of a <i>Carpenter</i>’s
Joynt-Rule are in the Centre, as at <i>c</i>, but with a
very strong Joynt; upon which Centre, or Joynt,
the Legs move wider, or closer together, as occasion
requires. Each Leg is about an Inch and a quarter
broad, and an Inch and three quarters deep; <i>viz.</i>
so deep as the Shank of the <i>Punch</i> is long. At the farther
end of the Shank b (as at <i>d</i>) is let in an Iron
Pin, with an Head at the farther end, and a square
Shank, to reach almost through a square Hole in the
Shank b, that it twists not about; and at the end
of that Square, a round Pin, with a Male-Screw
made on it, long enough to reach through the
Shank a, and about two Inches longer, as at <i>e</i>; upon
which Male-Screw is fitted a Nut with two Ears,
which hath a Female-Screw in it, that draws and
holds the Legs together, as occasion requires a bigger
or less <i>Punch</i> to be held in a proper Hole.
Through each of the adjoyning Insides of the Legs
are made, from the Upper to the Lower Side, six,
seven, or eight Semi-Circular Holes (or more or
less, according to discretion) exactly Perpendicular

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>

to the upper and under-sides of each Leg, marked
<i>a a a a</i>, <i>b b b b</i>. Each of these Semicircular Holes is,
when joyned to its Match, on the other Leg to
make a Circular Hole; and therefore must be made
on each Leg, at an equal distance from the Centre.
These Holes are not all of an equal Size, but different
Sizes: Those towards the Centre smallest, <i>viz.</i>
so small, that the <i>Punch</i> for the smallest Bodied Letters
may be pinched fast in them; and the biggest
Holes big enough to contain, pinch and hold fast
the <i>Punches</i> for the great Bodied Letters. The upper
and under-sides of this <i>Joynt-Flat-Gage</i> is Faced
with an Iron Plate, about the thickness of an Half
Crown, whose outer Superficies are both made exactly
Flat and Smooth.
</p>
<p>When he uses it, he chuses an Hole to fit the Size
of the <i>Punch</i>; and putting the Shank of the <i>Punch</i>
into that Hole, Sinks it down so low, till the Face
of the <i>Punch</i>, stands just Level, or rather, above
the Face of the <i>Joynt-Flat-Gage</i>: Then with a piece
of an Hone, wet in Water, rubs upon the Face of
the <i>Punch</i>, till he have wrought off the Scurf. At
last, with a Stick and Dry <i>Putty</i>, Polishes it.</p>

<p>I like my own way better than either of the former:
For, to take off the Scurf with Small Files
spoils the Files; the Face of the <i>Punch</i> being Hard,
and the Scurf yet Harder: And besides, endangers
the wronging the Face of the <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Joynt-Flat-Gage</i> is very troublesome to use,
because it is difficult to fit the Face of the <i>Punch</i>, to
lie in the Plain of the Face of the <i>Gage</i>; especially,
if, in making the Letter, the Shank be Filed Tapering,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span>

as it most times is. For then the Hammer-end of the <i>Punch</i> being
bigger than the Face-end, it will indeed Pinch at the Hammer-end,
whilst the Face-end stands unsteady to Work on. But when the
<i>Punch</i> is fitted in, it is no way more advantagious for Use, than
the Chaps of the _Hand-Vice_ I mentioned in ¶. 3. of this §.</p>

<p>Wherefore, I fit the <i>Punch</i> into the Chaps of the
<i>Hand-Vice</i>, as I shewed in the aforesaid ¶. and with
a fine smooth Whet-stone and Water, take the Scurf
lightly off the Face of the <i>Punch</i>; and afterwards,
with a fine smooth Hone and Water, work down
to the bare bright Steel. At last, drying the <i>Punch</i>
and Chaps of the <i>Hand-Vice</i> with a dry Rag, I pollish
the Face of the <i>Punch</i> with Powder of Dry <i>Brick</i>
and a Stick, as with <i>Putty</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Some Rules he considers in using the</i> Gravers,
Sculptors, Small Files, <i>&amp;c.</i></h4>

<p class="p2-indent">1. When he is Graving on the Inside of the Stroak,
either to make it Finer or Smoother, he takes an
especial care that he place his Graver or Sculptor so,
as that neither of its Edges may wrong another
Stroak of the Letter, if they chance (as they often
do) to slip over, or off an extuberant part of the
Stroak he is Graving upon. And therefore, I say,
he well considers how he is to manage the edges of
his Graver. For there is no great danger of the
point of his Graver after the inside Stroaks are
form’d, and the Hollows of the Letter somewhat
deepned; but in the edges there is: For the point

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>

in working lies always below the Face of the Letter,
and therefore can, at most, but slip below the
Face, against the side of the next Stroak; but the
edges lying above the Face of the Letter, may, in a
slip, touch upon the Side and Face of the next Stroak,
and wrong that more or less, according as the force
of the Slip was greater or smaller. And if that Stroak
it jobs against were before wholly finished, by that
job the whole Letter is in danger to be spoiled; at
the best, it cannot, without Filing the Letter lower,
be wrought out; which sometimes is a great part of
doing the Letter anew: For he takes special care
that neither any dawk, or the least extuberant bunching
out be upon the inside of the Face of the Stroak,
but that the inside of the Stroak (whether it be Fat
or Lean) have its proper Shape and Proportion, and
be purely smooth and clean all the way.</p>

<p>If on the inside of the Stroak the Graver or Sculptor
have not run straight and smooth on the Stroak,
but that an Extuberance lies on the Side, that Extuberance
cannot easily be taken off, by beginning to
Cut with the Edge of the Graver or Sculptor just
where the Extuberance begins: Therefore he fixes
the Point of his Graver or Sculptor in the Bottom of
the Hollow, just under the Stroak where the Extuberance
is, and leans the Edge of his Graver or Sculptor
upwards; so as in forcing the Point of the Graver
or Sculptor forwards, at the Bottom of the Hollow,
the Edge of the Graver or Sculptor may slide
tenderly along, and take along with it a very small,
nay, invisible Chip of the most Prominent Part of
the Extuberance; and so, by this Process reitterated

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>

often, he, by small Degrees, Cuts away the Extuberant
part of the Stroak.</p>

<p class="p2-indent">2. He is careful to keep his Gravers and Sculptors
always Sharp, by often Sharpning them on the Oyl-Stone,
which for that purpose he keeps ready at hand,
standing on the Bench: For if a Graver or Sculptor
be not sharp, it will neither make riddance, or Cut
smooth; but instead of Cutting off a small Extuberancy,
it will rather stick at it, and dig into the Side of
the Stroak.</p>

<p class="p2-indent">3. He Files very tenderly with the Small Files,
especially with the Knife-Files, as well because they
are Thin and Hard, not Temper’d, and therefore
would snap to pieces with small violence; as also,
lest with an heavy hand he should take away too
much at once of that Stroak he is working upon.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 14. ¶. 1. <i>Some Rules to be observed by the</i> Letter-Cutter,<br>
<i>in the Cutting</i> Roman, Italick, <i>and the</i><br>
Black English Letter.</h3>

<p class="p2-indent">1. The Stem and other Fat Stroaks of Capital
<i>Romans</i> is five Parts of forty and two (the whole
Body:) Or, (which is all one) one sixth part of the
Heighth of an Ascending Letter (as all Capitals are
Ascendents) as has been said before. <i>Albertus Dürer</i>
took his Measure from the Heighth of Capitals, and
assigned but one tenth part for the Stem.</p>

<p class="p2-indent">2. The Stem, and other Fat Stroaks of Capitals
<i>Italick</i>, is four parts of forty and two, (the Body.)</p>

<p class="p2-indent">3. The Stem, and other Fat Stroaks of Lower-Case

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of Terms relating to the Face of Letters,
and their Explanation.</i></h4>

<p>The Parts of a <i>Punch</i> are already described in
§. 13. ¶. 1. of this Volumne; and so is the Body:
But the several Terms that relate to the Face of Letters
are not yet defined. Now therefore you must
note, that the Body of a Letter hath four principal
Lines passing through it (or at least imagined to pass
through it) at Right Angles to the Body; <i>viz.</i> The
Top-Line, The Head-Line, The Foot-Line, and
The Bottom-Line.</p>

<p>Between two of these Lines is contained the
Heighth of all Letters.</p>

<p>These are called <i>Lines</i>, because the Tops, the
Heads, the Feet and the Bottoms of all Letters
(when Complicated by the <i>Compositor</i>) stand ranging
in these imagin’d Lines, according as the Heighth
and Depth of each respective Letter properly requires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>The Long-Letters are (as I told you in §. 13. ¶. 1.
of this Volumne) contained between the Top and
Bottom-Lines, The Ascending Letters are contained
between the Top and Foot-Lines, The Descending
Letters are contained between the Head and Bottom-Lines,
and The Short-Letters are contained between
the Head and Foot-Lines.</p>

<p>Through what Parts of the Body all these Lines
pass, you may see by the Drafts of Letters, and the
following Descriptions.</p>

<p>What the Long-Letters, Ascending Letters, and
Short-Letters are, I shewed in the afore-cited ¶.
Therefore I shall now proceed to particular Terms
relating to the Face. As,</p>

<p>1. The Topping, is the straight fine Stroak or
Stroaks that lie in the Top-Line of Ascending Letters:
In <i>Roman</i> Letters they pass at Right Angles
through the Stems; but in <i>Italicks</i>, at Oblique
Angles to the Stems; as you may see in the Drafts of
Letters, B, <i>B</i>, H, <i>H</i>, I, <i>I</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>2. The Footing, is the straight fine Stroak or
Stroaks that lie in the Foot-Line of Letters, either
Ascending or Descending. In <i>Romans</i> they pass at
Right Angles through the Stem, but in <i>Italicks</i>, at
Oblique Angles; as you may see in B, <i>B</i>, H, <i>H</i>,
I, <i>I</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>3. The Bottom-Footing, is the straight fine Stroaks
that lie in the Bottom-Line of Descending Letters.
In <i>Romans</i> they pass at Right Angles through the
Stem; but in <i>Italicks</i> at Oblique Angles; as you
may see p, <i>p</i>, q, <i>q</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>4. The Stem is the straight Fat Stroak of the Letter:
as in B, <i>B</i>, the straight Stroak on the Left-Hand
is the Stem; and I, <i>I</i>, is all Stem, except the Footing
and Topping.</p>

<p>5. Fat Stroaks. The Stem or broad Stroak in a
Letter is called Fat; as the Right Hand Stroak in
A, and part of the great Arch in B, are Fat Stroaks.</p>

<p>6. Lean Stroaks, are the narrow fine Stroaks in a
Letter; as the Left-Hand Stroak of A, and the
Right Hand Stroak of V are Lean.</p>

<p>7. Beak of Letters, is the fine Stroak or Touch
that stands on the Left-Hand of the Stem, either in
the Top-Line, as b d h, <i>&amp;c.</i> or in the Head-Line,
as i, m, n, <i>&amp;c.</i> Yet f, g, [s], <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, [<i>s</i>] have Beaks on the
Right Hand of the Stem.</p>

<p>8. Tails of Letters, is a Stroak proceeding from
the Right-Hand Side of the Stem, in the Foot-Line;
as a d t u: and most <i>Italick</i> Lower-Case Letters
have Tails: As also have most Swash-Letters. But
several of their Tails reach down to the Bottom-Line.</p>

<p>9. Swash-Letters are <i>Italick</i> Capitals; as you see
in <i>Plate</i> 15.</p>

<p>Thus much of <i>Letter-Cutting</i>. The next <i>Exercises</i>
shall (God willing) be upon <i>Making Matrices</i>, <i>Making
Molds</i>, <i>Casting and Dressing of Letters</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>§. 15. ¶. 1. <i>Of making the</i> Mold.</h3>

<p>The <i>Steel-Punches</i> being thus finish’d,
as afore was shewed, they are to be
sunk or struck into pieces of <i>Copper</i>, about
an Inch and an half long, and one
quarter of an Inch deep; but the thickness
not assignable, because of the different thicknesses
in Letters, as was shewed in §. 2. and shall further
be shewed, when I come to the sinking and justifying

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>

of <i>Matrices</i>. But before these <i>Punches</i> are
sunk into <i>Copper</i>, the <i>Letter-Founder</i> must provide a
<i>Mold</i> to justifie the <i>Matrices</i> by: And therefore it is
proper that I describe this <i>Mold</i> to you before I proceed
any farther.</p>

<p>I have given you in Plate 18. at A, the Draft of
one side or half of the <i>Mold</i>; and in Plate 19. at B,
its Match, or other half, which I shall in general thus
describe.</p>

<p>Every <i>Mold</i> is made of two parts, an under, and
an upper Part; the under part is delineated at A, in
Plate 18, the upper part is marked B, in Plate 19,
and is in all respects made like the under part, excepting
the <i>Stool</i> behind, and the <i>Bow</i>, or <i>Spring</i> also behind;
and excepting a small roundish <i>Wyer</i> between
the <i>Body</i> and <i>Carriage</i>, near the <i>Break</i>, where the
under part hath a small rounding <i>Groove</i> made in the
Body. This <i>Wyer</i>, or rather <i>Half-Wyer</i> in the upper
part makes the <i>Nick</i> in the <i>Shank</i> of the Letter, when
part of it is received into the Grove in the under part.</p>

<p>These two parts are so exactly fitted and gaged into
one another, (<i>viz.</i> the <i>Male Gage</i>, marked C in
Plate 19, into the <i>Female-Gage</i> marked g, in Plate
18.) that when the upper part of the <i>Mold</i> is properly
placed on, and in the under part of the <i>Mold</i>
both together, makes the entire <i>Mold</i>, and may be
slid backwards for Use so far, till the Edge of either
of the Bodies on the middle of either <i>Carriage</i> comes
just to the Edge of the <i>Female-Gages</i>, cut in each <i>Carriage</i>:
And they may be slid forwards so far, till the
Bodies on either <i>Carriage</i> touch each other. And the
sliding of these two parts of the <i>Mold</i> backwards,
makes the <i>Shank</i> of the Letter thicker, because the
Bodies in each part stand wider asunder; and the sliding
them forwards makes the <i>Shank</i> of the Letter
thinner, because the Bodies on each part of the <i>Mold</i>
stand closer together.</p>

<p>I have here given you only the Names of the parts
of the <i>Mold</i>, because at present I purpose no other
Use of it, than what relates to the sinking the <i>Punches</i>
into the <i>Matrices</i>: And when I come to the casting
of Letters, You will find the Use and Necessity
of all these Parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of the</i> Bottom-Plate.</h4>

<p>The <i>Bottom-Plate</i> is made of <i>Iron</i>, about two Inches
and three quarters long, and about the same breadth;
its thickness about a <i>Brevier</i>: It is planisht exactly
flat and straight: It hath two of its <i>Fore-Angles</i>, as <i>a a</i>
cut off either straight or rounding, according to the
pleasure of the Workman.</p>

<p>About the place where the middle of the <i>Carriage</i>
lies, is made a Hole about a <i>Great-Primmer</i> square, into
which is rivetted on the upper-side a Pin with a
Sholder to it, which reaches about half an Inch through
the under-side of the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>. This <i>Pin</i> on the
under-side the <i>Bottom-Plate</i> is round, and hath a <i>Male-Screw</i>
on its end. This <i>Pin</i> is let through a Hole
made in the Wood of the <i>Mold</i> to fit it; so that when
a square <i>Nut</i>, with a <i>Female-Screw</i> in it, is turned on
the <i>Male-Screw</i>, it may draw and fasten the <i>Half
Mold</i> firm to the Wood.</p>

<p>The Hind-side of the <i>Carriage</i> lies on this <i>Bottom-Plate</i>,
parallel to the Hind-side of it, and about a
<i>Two-Lin’d-English</i> within the Hind Edge of it; and
so much of this <i>Bottom-Plate</i> as is between the <i>Register</i>
and the left-hand end of the <i>Carriage</i> (as it is posited
in the Figure) is called the <i>Stool</i>, as <i>g g</i> in the
under half of the <i>Mold</i>, because on it the lower end
of the <i>Matrice</i> rests; but on the upper half of the
<i>Mold</i> is made a square Notch behind in the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>,
rather within than without the Edge of the
<i>Carriage</i>, to reach from the <i>Register</i>, and half an Inch
towards the left-hand (as it is posited in the Figure)

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>

that the upper part of the fore-side of the <i>Matrice</i>
may stand close to the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of the</i> Carriage.</h4>
<p>On the <i>Bottom-Plate</i> is fitted a <i>Carriage</i>, (as <i>a</i>) This
<i>Carriage</i> is almost the length of the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, and
about a <i>Double-Pica</i> thick, and its Breadth the length
of the Shank of the Letter to be cast.</p>

<p>This <i>Carriage</i> is made of <i>Iron</i>, and hath its upper
side, and its two narrow sides filed and rubed upon
the using <i>File</i>, exactly straight, square and smooth,
and the two opposite narrow sides exactly parallel to
each other.</p>

<p>On one end of the <i>Carriage</i>, as at g, is made a
long <i>Notch</i> or <i>Slit</i>, which I call the <i>Female-Gage</i>:
It is about a <i>Double-Pica</i> wide, and is made for the
<i>Male-Gage</i> of the other part of the <i>Mold</i> to fit into,
and to slide forwards or backwards as the thickness
of the Letter to be cast may require.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of the</i> Body.</h4>

<p>Upon the <i>Carriage</i> is fitted the <i>Body</i>, as at b. This
<i>Body</i> is also made of <i>Iron</i>, and is half the length of
the <i>Carriage</i>, and the exact breadth of the <i>Carriage</i>;
but its thickness is alterable, and particularly made
for every intended <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>About the middle of this <i>Body</i> is made a square
Hole, about a <i>Great-Primmer</i>, or <i>Double-Pica</i> square;
and directly under it is made through the <i>Carriage</i>
such another Hole exactly of the same size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Of the</i> Male-Gage.</h4>

<p>Through these two Holes, <i>viz.</i> That in the <i>Body</i>,
and that in the <i>Carriage</i>, is fitted a square <i>Iron Shank</i>
with a <i>Male-Screw</i> on one End, and on the other
End an Head turning square from the square <i>Shanck</i>
to the farther end of the <i>Body</i>, as is described at c;
but is more particularly described apart at B in
the same Plate, where B may be called the <i>Male-Gage</i>:
For I know no distinct Name that <i>Founders</i>
have for it, and do therefore coyn this:</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>a</i> The <i>square Shanck</i>.</li>
<li><i>b</i> The <i>Male-Screw</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This <i>square Shanck</i> is just so long within half a <i>Scaboard</i>
thick as to reach through the <i>Body</i>, <i>Carriage</i>, and
another square Hole made through the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>,
that so when a <i>square Nut</i> with a <i>Female-Screw</i> in it
is turned on that <i>Pin</i>, the <i>Nut</i> shall draw and fasten
the <i>Body</i> and <i>Carriage</i> down to the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>.</p>

<p>The Office of the <i>Male-Gage</i> is to fit into, and slide
along the <i>Female-Gage</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 6. <i>Of the</i> Mouth-Piece.</h4>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p134b.png" width="600" height="811" alt="Image: Plate 19.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 19.</i><br>
<i>The Upper half of the Mold</i></span>
</div>

<p>Close to the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i> is fitted a <i>Mouth-Piece</i>
marked <i>d e</i>. <i>Letter-Founders</i> call this altogether
a <i>Mouth-Piece</i>: But that I may be the better understood
in this present purpose, I must more nicely
distinguish its parts, and take the Freedom to elect
Terms for them, as first,</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>c c e</i> The <i>Mouth</i>.</li>
<li><i>d</i> The <i>Palate</i>.</li>
<li><i>c c</i> e <i>d</i> The <i>Jaws</i>.</li>
<li><i>d d</i> The <i>Throat</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Altogether (as aforesaid) the <i>Mouth-Piece</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Mouth-Piece</i> hath its <i>Side</i> returning from the
<i>Throat</i> filed and rubb’d on the <i>Using-File</i> exactly
straight and square to its <i>Bottom-side</i>, because it is to
joyn close to the Side of the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>; but
its upper-side, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Palate</i> is not parallel to the
<i>Bottom</i>, but from the Side <i>d d</i>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Throat</i> falls
away to the <i>Mouth</i> e, making an <i>Angle</i> greater or
smaller, as the <i>Body</i> that the <i>Mold</i> is made for is bigger
or less: For small <i>Bodies</i> require but a small <i>Mouth</i>,
because small <i>Ladles</i> will hold Metal enough for small
Letters; and the smaller the <i>Ladle</i>, the finer the <i>Geat</i>
of the <i>Ladle</i> is; and fine <i>Geats</i> will easier hit the
<i>Mouth</i> (in a Train of Work) than the course <i>Geats</i> of
Great <i>Ladles</i>: Therefore it is that the <i>Mouth</i> must
be made to such a convenient Width, that the <i>Ladle</i>
to be used and its <i>Geat</i>, may readily, and without
slabbering, receive the Metal thrown into the <i>Mold</i>.</p>

<p>But again, if the <i>Mouth-Piece</i> be made too wide,
<i>viz.</i> the <i>Jaws</i> too deep at the <i>Mouth</i>, though the
<i>Geat</i> of the <i>Ladle</i> does the readier find it, yet the
<i>Body</i> of the <i>Break</i> of the <i>Letter</i> will be so great, that
first it heats the <i>Mold</i> a great deal faster and hotter;
and secondly, it empties the <i>Pan</i> a great deal sooner
of its Metal, and subjects the Workman sometime
to stand still while other Metal is melted and hot:
Therefore Judgment is to be used in the width of
the <i>Mouth</i>; and though there be no Rule for the
width of it; yet this in general for such <i>Molds</i> as I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>

make, I observe that the <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>Throat</i> may
be about one quarter of the Body for small Bodies;
but for great Bodies less, according to Discretion,
and the <i>Palate</i> about an Inch and a quarter long from
the <i>Body</i> and <i>Carriage</i>. The reason that the <i>Orifice</i>
of the <i>Throat</i> is so small, is, because the Substance at
the end of the <i>Shanck</i> of the Letter ought also to be
small, that the <i>Break</i> may easier break from the <i>Shanck</i>
of the Letter, and the less subject the <i>Shanck</i> to bowing;
for the bowing of a Letter spoils it; and the
reason why the <i>Palate</i> is so long, is, that the <i>Break</i>
being long, may be the easier finger’d and manag’d
in the breaking.</p>

<p>If it be objected, that since the smalness of the
<i>Break</i> at the end of the <i>Shanck</i> of the Letter is so approvable
and necessary for the reason aforesaid, then
why may not the <i>Break</i> be made much more smaller yet?
The Answer will be, No; because if it be much smaller
than one quarter of the Body, Metal enough will
not pass through the <i>Throat</i>, to fill both the <i>Face</i> and
<i>Shanck</i> of the Letter, especially if the Letter to be cast
prove thin.</p>

<p>Near the <i>Throat</i> and <i>Jaw</i> is made straight down
through the <i>Palate</i> a square Hole (as at <i>k</i>.) This square
Hole hath all its Sides on the <i>Upper-Plain</i> of the <i>Palate</i>
opened to a <i>Bevel</i> of about 45 Degrees, and about the
depth of a thick <i>Scaboard</i>. Into this square <i>Hole</i> is fitted
a square <i>Pin</i> to reach through it; and within half a
<i>Scaboard</i> through a square <i>Hole</i>, made just under it
in the <i>Bottom-Plate</i> which the <i>Mouth-Piece</i> lies upon.
On the upper end of this square <i>Pin</i> is made a square
<i>Sholder</i>, whose under-sides are filed <i>Bevil</i> away, so as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>

to comply and fall just into the <i>Bevil</i> made on the
<i>Palate</i> aforesaid, and on the under end of the <i>Pin</i> is
made a <i>Male-screw</i> long enough to contain a square
<i>Nut</i>, with a <i>Female-screw</i> in it about a <i>Pica</i> or <i>English</i>
thick, which <i>Nut</i> being twisted about the <i>Pin</i>
of the <i>Male-screw</i>, draws and fastens the <i>Mouth-piece</i>
close down to the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, and also close to the
<i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i> of the <i>Mold</i>.</p>

<p>Note, that the square <i>Hole</i> made in the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>
to receive the square <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Pin</i>, must be made
a little wider than just to fit the square <i>Shanck</i> of the
<i>Pin</i>, because the <i>Mouth-piece</i> must be so placed, that
the end of the <i>Jaw</i> next the <i>Throat</i> must lie just even
with the <i>Body</i> it is to be joyned to; and also that the
<i>Throat</i> of the <i>Mouth-piece</i> may be thrust perfectly close
to the Sides of the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>: And when Occasion
requires the <i>Shanck</i> of the Letter to be lengthned,
it may be set farther off the <i>Carriage</i>, that an
<i>Asidue</i>, or sometimes a thin <i>Plate</i> of <i>Brass</i> may be fitted
in between the <i>Carriage</i> and the <i>Throat</i> of the
<i>Mouth-piece</i>, as shall farther be shewed when I come
to justifie the <i>Mold</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶.  7. <i>Of the</i> Register.</h4>

<p>Behind the <i>Mold</i> is placed the <i>Register</i>, as at <i>f i h</i>,
which I have also placed apart in the aforesaid Plate,
as at C, that it may the more perspicuously be discerned,
and a more particular account of its parts be
given, which are as follows:<br></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>C <i>a a b c d e</i> The <i>Register</i>.</li>
<li><i>a a</i> The <i>Sholders</i>.</li>
<li><i>b c</i> The <i>Neck</i>.</li>
<li><i>d</i> The <i>Cheek</i> returning square from the Plate of the
<i>Register</i>, and is about an <i>English</i> thick.</li>
<li><i>e</i> The <i>Screw Hole</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>It is made of an <i>Iron</i> Plate about a <i>Brevier</i> thick;
its upper-side is straight, but its under-side is not:
For at <i>a a</i> projects downwards a small piece of the same
Plate, which we may call the <i>Sholders</i>, of the Form
you see in the Figure. These <i>Sholders</i> have two small
<i>Notches</i> (as at <i>b c</i>) filed in them below the <i>Range</i> on
the under-side of the <i>Register</i>, which we will call the
<i>Neck</i>, and is just so wide as the <i>Bottom-Plate</i> is thick.
This <i>Neck</i> is set into a square <i>Notch</i>, filed so far into
the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, that the flat inside of the <i>Register</i>
may stand close against the hind-side of the <i>Carriage</i>
and <i>Body</i>; and this <i>Notch</i> is filed so wide on the left
Hand, that when the side <i>b</i> of the <i>Neck</i> stands close
against the left-hand-side of this <i>Notch</i> (as it is posited
in the Figure) the <i>Cheek</i> of the <i>Register</i> stands just even
with the Edge of the <i>Body</i>. And this <i>Notch</i> is also
filed so wide on the right-Hand-side, that when
the <i>Neck</i> at <i>c</i> stands close against the right-hand Side
of the <i>Notch</i>, the <i>Cheek</i> of the <i>Register</i> may remove
an m, or an m and an n from the edge of the <i>Body</i>
towards the right hand: And the <i>Sholders a a</i> are
made so long, that when either Side of the <i>Neck</i> is
thrust close against its corresponding side in the <i>Notch</i>
of the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, the upper Edge of the opposite
<i>Sholder</i> shall hook or bear against the under-side of
the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, and keep the whole <i>Register</i> steady,
and directly upright to the Surface of the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>In the Plate of the <i>Register</i>, is made a long square
Hole, as at <i>e</i>, just wide enough to receive the <i>Pin</i> of
a <i>Male-screw</i>, with a <i>Sholder</i> to it, which is to fit into
a <i>Female-screw</i>, made in the Edge of the <i>Carriage</i>,
that when the <i>Male-screw</i> is turned about in the <i>Female-screw</i>
in the <i>Carriage</i>, it shall draw the <i>Sholder</i>
of the said <i>Male-screw</i> hard against the upper and under
Sides of the square Hole in the Plate of the <i>Register</i>,
close to the side of the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>The reason why the Hole in the Plate of the <i>Register</i>
is made so long, is that the <i>Cheek</i> of the <i>Register</i>
may be slid forwards or backwards as occasion requires;
as shall be shewn when I come to justifying
the <i>Mold</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 8. <i>Of the</i> Nick.</h4>

<p>In the upper half of the <i>Mold</i>, at about a <i>Pica</i> distance
from the <i>Throat</i>, is fitted into the under-side
of the <i>Body</i> the <i>Nick</i>: It is made of a piece of <i>Wyer</i>
filed flat a little more than half away. This <i>Nick</i> is
bigger or less, as the Body the <i>Mold</i> is made for is
bigger or less; but its length is about two <i>m</i>’s. It is
with round <i>Sculptors</i> let exactly into the under-side
of the <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>In the under half of the <i>Mold</i>, is made at the same
distance from the <i>Throat</i>, on the upper-side of the
<i>Body</i>, a round <i>Groove</i>, just fit to receive the <i>Nick</i> in
the upper half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 9. <i>Of the</i> Bow <i>or Spring</i>.</h4>

<p>This is a long piece of hard <i>Iron Wyer</i>, whose Diameter
is about a <i>Brevier</i> thick, and hath one end fastned
into the Wood of the under half of the <i>Mold</i>,
as at <i>h</i>; but it is so fastned, that it may turn about in
the Hole of the Wood it is put into: For the end of
it being batter’d flat, a small Hole is drilled through
it, into which small Hole the end of fine <i>Lute-string
Wyer</i>, or somewhat bigger is put, and fastned by twisting
about half an Inch of the end of the <i>Lute-string</i>
to the rest of the <i>Lute-string</i>: For then a considerable
Bundle of that <i>Wyer</i>, of about the Size of a Doublet
Button, being wound behind the Hole, about the
end of the <i>Spring</i>, will become a <i>Sholder</i> to it, and
keep the end of the <i>Spring</i> from slipping through the
Hole in the Wood: But this <i>Button</i> or <i>Sholder</i> must
also be kept on by thrusting another piece of <i>Wyer</i>
stiff into the Hole made on the end of the <i>Spring</i>,
and crooking that <i>Wyer</i> into the Form of an S, that
it slip not out of the Hole.</p>

<p>The manner how the <i>Spring</i> is bowed, you may
see in the Figure: But just without the Wood is
twisted upon another <i>Wyer</i> about an <i>English</i> thick
five or six turns of the <i>Wyer</i> of the <i>Spring</i>, to make
the whole <i>Spring</i> bear the stronger at its point: For
the Office of the <i>Spring</i> is with its Point at <i>g</i>, to thrust
the <i>Matrice</i> close against the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 10. <i>Of the</i> Hooks, <i>or</i> Haggs.</h4>

<p>These are <i>Iron Wyers</i> about a <i>Long-Primmer</i> thick:
Their Shape you may see in the Figure: They are so
fastned into the Wood of the <i>Mold</i>, that they may
not hinder the <i>Ladle</i> hitting the <i>Mouth</i>. Their Office
is to pick and draw with their Points the <i>Break</i>
and <i>Letter</i> out of the <i>Mold</i> when they may chance to
stick.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 11. <i>Of the</i> Woods <i>of the</i> Mold.</h4>

<p>All the <i>Iron</i> Work aforesaid of the <i>Mold</i> is fitted
and fastned on two Woods, <i>viz.</i> each half one, and
each Wood about an Inch thick, and of the shape of
each respective <i>Bottom-Plate</i>. The Wood hath all its
Sides except the hind-side, about a <i>Pica</i> longer than
the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>; but the hind-side lies even with
the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>. The <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, as afore was said
in ¶. 2. of this §. hath an <i>Iron Pin</i> on its under-side,
about half an Inch long, with a <i>Male-screw</i> on its end,
which <i>Pin</i> being let fit into an Hole in the Wood
does by a <i>Nut</i> with a <i>Female-screw</i> in it draw, all the
<i>Iron</i> Work close and fast to the Wood.</p>

<p>But because the Wood is an Inch thick, and the
<i>Pin</i> in the <i>Bottom-Plate</i> but half an Inch long, therefore
the outer or under-side of the Wood (as posited
in the Figure) hath a wide round Hole made in it flat
at the Bottom, to reach within an <i>English</i>, or a <i>Great
Primmer</i> of the upper-side of the Wood. This round
Hole is wide enough to receive the <i>Nut</i> with the <i>Female-screw</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>

in it; and the <i>Pin</i> being now long enough
to receive the <i>Female-screw</i> at the wide Hole, the
<i>Female-screw</i> may with <i>round nosed Plyers</i> be turned
about the <i>Male-screw</i> on the <i>Pin</i> aforesaid, till it draw
all the <i>Iron</i> Work close to the Wood.</p>

<p>The Wood behind on the upper half is cut away
as the <i>Bottom-Plate</i> of that half is; and into the thickness
of the Wood, close by the right and left-hand
side of this <i>Notch</i> is a small square <i>Wyer-staple</i> driven,
which we may call the <i>Matrice-Check</i>; for its Office
is only to keep the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> from flying
out of this <i>Notch</i> of the <i>Mold</i> when the <i>Caster</i> is at
Work. And the <i>Nuts</i> and <i>Screws</i> of the <i>Carriage</i> and
<i>Mouth-piece</i>, &amp;c. that lie under the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>, are
with small <i>Chissels</i> let into the upper-side of the Wood,
that the <i>Bottom-plates</i> may lie flat on it.</p>

<br>
<p class="center large">Sect. XVI. <i>Of justifying the</i> Mold.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Mold</i> be now made; nay, very well
and Workman-like made, yet is it not imagin’d
to be fit to go to work withal; as well because it will
doubtless Rag (as <i>Founders</i> call it; for which Explanation
see the Table) as because the Body, Thickness,
Straightness, and length of the <i>Shanck</i> must be
finisht with such great Nicety, that without several
Proofs and Tryings, it cannot be expected to be perfectly
true.</p>

<p>Therefore before the sinking and justifying the
<i>Matrices</i>, the <i>Mold</i> must first be <i>Justified</i>: And first,
he justifies the <i>Body</i>, which to do, he casts about
twenty <i>Proofs</i> or Letters, as they are called, though it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>

matters not whether the <i>Shancks</i> have yet Letters
on them or no. These <i>Proofs</i> he sets up in a <i>Composing-stick</i>,
as is described in §.  17. ¶. 2. Plate 19. at G,
with all their <i>Nicks</i> towards the right Hand, and
then sets up so many Letters of the same <i>Body</i>, (which
for Distinction sake we will call <i>Patterns</i>) that he
will justifie his <i>Body</i> too, upon the <i>Proofs</i>, with all
their <i>Nicks</i> also to the right Hand, to try if they agree
in length with the same Number of Letters that
he uses for his <i>Pattern</i>; which if they do not, for very
seldom they do, but by the Workman’s fore-cast
are generally somewhat too big in the <i>Body</i>, that
there may be Substance left to <i>Justifie</i> the <i>Mold</i>, and
clear it from <i>Ragging</i>. Therefore the <i>Proofs</i> may
drive-out somewhat, either half a Line (which in
<i>Founders</i> and <i>Printers</i> Language is half a <i>Body</i>) or a
whole Line. (more or less.)</p>

<p>He also tries if the two sides of the <i>Body</i> are parallel,
<i>viz.</i> That the <i>Body</i> be no bigger at the <i>Head</i> than
at the <i>Foot</i>; and that he tries by taking half the number
of his <i>Proofs</i>, and turning the Heads of them
lays them upon the other half of his <i>Proofs</i>, so that
if then the <i>Heads</i> and <i>Feet</i> be exactly even upon
each other, and that the Heads and Feet neither <i>drive
out</i>, nor <i>get in</i>, (<i>Founders</i> and <i>Printers</i> Language, for
which see the Table) the two sides of the <i>Body</i> are
parallel; but if either the <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot drives
out</i>, the two sides of the <i>Body</i> are not parallel, and
must therefore be mended.</p>

<p>And as he has examin’d the Sides of the <i>Body</i> so also
he examines the thickness of the Letter, and tries
if the two Sides of the thickness be also parallel, which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>

to do, he sets up his <i>Prooves</i> in the <i>Composing-stick</i>
with their <i>Nicks</i> upwards. Then taking half of the
<i>Prooves</i>, he turns the <i>Heads</i> and lay the <i>Heads</i> upon
the <i>Feet</i> of the other half of his <i>Prooves</i>, and if the
<i>Heads</i> and <i>Feet</i> lies exactly upon each other and neither
<i>drive out</i> or <i>get in</i> the two Sides of the thicknesses
are parallel. But if either the <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i>
<i>drive-out</i> the two Sides of the thicknesses are not parallel;
and must therefore be mended.</p>

<p>Next, he considers whether the sides of the <i>Body</i>
be straight, first by laying two Letters with their
<i>Nicks</i> upwards upon one another, and holding them
up in his Fingers, between his Eye and the Light,
tries if he can see Light between them: For if the
least Light appear between them, the <i>Carriage</i> is not
straight. Then he lays the <i>Nicks</i> against one another,
and holds them also against the Light, as before:
Then he lays both the <i>Nicks</i> outward, and examines
them that way, that he may find whether either or
both of the <i>Carriages</i> are out of straight.</p>

<p>But we will suppose now the <i>Body</i> somewhat too
big, and that it drives out at the <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i>; and
that the thickness <i>drives out</i> at the <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i> and
that the Sides of the <i>Body</i> are not straight. These
are Faults enough to take the <i>Mold</i> asunder: but yet
if there were but one of these Faults it must be taken
asunder for that; by unscrewing the <i>Male-Gage</i>,
to take the <i>Body off</i> the <i>Carriage</i>, and the <i>Carriage</i>
off the <i>Bottom-Plate</i>.</p>

<p>Having found where the Fault of one or both sides
of the <i>Body</i> is, he lays the <i>Body</i> down upon the <i>Using
File</i>; and if the Fault be extuberant, he rubs the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>

Extuberancy down, by pressing his Finger or Fingers
hard upon the opposite side of the Body, just over
the extuberant part; and so rubbing the Body
hard forwards on the <i>Using-File</i>, and drawing it lightly
backwards, he rubs till he has wrought down the
extuberancy, which he examins by applying the
<i>Lyner</i> to that side of the Body, and holding it so
up between his Eye and the Light, tries whether
or not the <i>Lyner</i> ride upon the part that was extuberant;
which if it do, the extuberancy is not sufficiently
rub’d off, and the former Process must
again begin and be continued till the extuberancy
be rub’d off. And if the Body were too big, he by
this Operation works it down: Because the extuberancy
of the <i>Body</i> rid upon the <i>Carriage</i>, and bore
it up.</p>

<p>And if the fault be a <i>Dawk</i>, or Hollow in the <i>Body</i>,
then he Works the rest of that side of the <i>Body</i>
down to the bottom of the <i>Dawk</i>, which by applying
the <i>Lyner</i> (as afore) he tryes, and this also lessens
the <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>If the <i>Body</i> drive-out at <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i>, he lays
the weight of his Fingers heavy at that side or end
of the <i>Body</i> which is too thick, and so rubs that
down harder.</p>

<p>If the thickness of the Letter, drive-out at
<i>Head</i>, or <i>Foot</i>, he Screws the <i>Body</i> into the <i>Vice</i>,
and with a flat sharp <i>File</i>, files the <i>Side</i> down at
the <i>Head</i>, or <i>Foot</i>. At the same time, if the <i>Shanck</i>
of the Letter be not Square, he mends that also, and
smooth-files it very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Then he puts the <i>Mold</i> together again: And
melting, (or laying aside) his first <i>Proofs</i>, lest they
should make him mistake, he again <i>Casts</i> about
twenty New <i>Proofs</i>, and examins by them as before,
how well he has mended the <i>Body</i>, and how
near he has brought the <i>Body</i> to the size of the <i>Pattern</i>:
For he does not expect to do it the <i>First</i>,
<i>Second</i>, or <i>Seventh</i> time; but mends on, on, on,
by a little at a time, till at last it is so finisht.</p>

<p>If the <i>Body</i> prove too small, it is underlaid with a
thick or a thin <i>Asidue</i>; or sometimes a thin <i>Plate</i> of
<i>Brass</i>.</p>

<p>Then he examins the <i>Mouth-piece</i>, and sees that
the <i>Jaws</i> slide exactly true, upon every part of the
<i>Pallat</i> without riding.</p>

<p>If the <i>Throat</i> of the <i>Mouth-piece</i> lie too low, as most
commonly it is designed so to do; Then a <i>Plate</i>
of <i>Brass</i> of a proper thickness is laid under it to
raise it higher.</p>

<p>He also Justifies the <i>Registers</i>, making their <i>Cheeks</i>
truly Square. And Screwing them about an n from
the Corner of the <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p>He tryes that the <i>Male</i> and <i>Female-Gages</i> fit each
other exactly, and lie directly straight along, and
parallel to both the Sides of the <i>Carriage</i>.</p>

<p>All this thus performed he needs not (perhaps)
take the <i>Mold</i> assunder again. But not having yet
consider’d, or examin’d the length of the <i>Shanck</i> of
the Letter, he now does; and if it be somewhat too
long (as we will suppose by forecast it is) then the
<i>Body</i> and <i>Carriage</i> being Screwed together, and both
the Halves fitted in their <i>Gages</i>, the Edges of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>

<i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i> are thus together rub’d upon the
<i>Using-File</i>, till the <i>Carriage</i> be brought to an exact
length.</p>

<p>Having thus (as he hopes) finisht the justifying
of the <i>Mold</i>; and put it together, and Screwed it fast
up, he puts the two Halves together, and then
Rubs or Slides them hard against one another, to
try if he can perceive any little part of the <i>Body</i> Ride
upon the <i>Carriage</i>, or <i>Carriage</i> ride upon the <i>Body</i>:
To know which of them it is that Rides, or is extuberant,
he uses the <i>Liner</i>; applying it to both the Places,
as well of the <i>Body</i> as the <i>Carriage</i>: where he sees
they have Rub’d or bore upon one another: And
which of them that is extuberant, the Edge of the <i>Liner</i>
will shew, by Riding upon it: And that part he Files
upon with a small flat and very fine <i>File</i>, by little
and little, taking off the extuberancy, till the <i>Bodies</i>
and <i>Carriages</i> lie exactly flat upon, and close to one
another: Which if they do not, the <i>Mold</i> will be sure
to <i>Rag</i>.</p>

<h3>§. XVII. ¶. 1. <i>Of Sinking the</i> Punches <i>into the</i>
Matrices.</h3>

<p>That the <i>Matrice</i>, and all its parts may be the
better understood, as I shall have Occasion
to Name them, I have given you a <i>Draft</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>
in Plate, 18 at E. and shall here explain its parts.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>E</i> The <i>Matrice</i>, wherein is Punched E, the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i>.</li>
<li><i>a</i> The <i>Bottom</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</li>
<li><i>b</i> The <i>Top</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</li>
<li><i>c</i> The <i>Right-side</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</li>
<li><i>d</i> The <i>Left Side</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</li>
<li><i>f g</i> The <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</li>
<li><i>h i</i> The <i>Leather Grove</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Back</i> or <i>Side</i> behind the <i>Matrice</i>, just behind
E is filed in athwart the <i>Back</i>, from the right
to the left Side a <i>Notch</i>, to settle and hold the point
of the <i>Spring</i> or <i>Wyer</i> of the <i>Mold</i> in, that the <i>Matrice</i>
fly or start not back when it is at Work.</p>

<p>As I told you (in §. 11. ¶. 1.) that the <i>Punches</i> are
to be made of several Thicknesses, for reasons there
shewed; and that therefore the <i>Letter-Cutter</i> makes
<i>Wooden Patterns</i> for his several Sizes of Thicknesses
as well as Heights; so now I am come to the <i>Sinking</i>
of the <i>Punches</i> into the <i>Matrices</i>, I must tell you
again that the <i>Letter-Cutter</i> or else the <i>Founder</i>, (either
of which that <i>Sinks</i> them; for sometimes it is
a Task Incumbent on each of them) considers the
Thicknesses of all the <i>Punches</i> he has to <i>Sink</i>, though
Heighth he need not consider in <i>Sinking</i> the <i>Matrices</i>:
For the <i>Matrices</i>, by reason of their length in <i>Copper</i>
upwards and downwards, have Substance enough
and to spare, for the longest Letters to be <i>Sunk</i> into
them: Therefore I say, he only considers the several
Thicknesses of all the <i>Punches</i>, and makes <i>Wooden
Patterns</i> for them, marking with a Pen and Inck
the number of each size, on the <i>Pattern</i> as before he
did for the <i>Steel-Punches</i>: But the <i>Patterns</i> he made
for the <i>Steel-Punches</i> will be too Thin for the <i>Copper
Matrices</i>: Because the <i>Steel-Punches</i> by <i>Sinking</i> into
the <i>Matrices</i>, stretch and force the Sides of the <i>Copper</i>
out, and sometimes crack them for want of Substance;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>

and at other times carry or force the Substance
of the <i>Matrice</i> so low with their <i>Sholder</i> if the
<i>Letter</i> be broad, that it creates a great Trouble to rub
them <i>Flat</i>, (as it is called) because it is done upon
the <i>Using-File</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore he makes <i>Wooden Patterns</i> for every
of the former siz’d <i>Punches</i>, so thick or rather an
n thicker at the least, then he made the <i>Wooden</i>
<i>Patterns</i>, that the <i>Steel-Punches</i> were made to be
<i>Forged</i> by, that there may be Substance enough
on each side the <i>Copper</i> to bear the dilating that
the sinking of the <i>Punch</i> into it will make, because
the <i>Counter-Puncht-Letters</i> are Thicker by their
<i>Stems</i> and <i>Footing</i> or <i>Topping</i> than the <i>Counter-Punches</i>
made for them need be.</p>

<p>Therefore (as before) for three sizes of <i>Punches</i>
to be <i>Counter-Puncht</i>, he made three several
siz’d <i>Patterns</i>; so now for the several siz’d <i>Punches</i>
that are to be <i>Sunk</i> into <i>Matrices</i>, he makes
three several siz’d <i>Patterns</i> of <i>Wood</i> for the <i>Copper-Smith</i>
to draw out <i>Rods</i> of <i>Copper</i> of those several
Sizes by, and each of them (as aforesaid) an n, and
for the Thick <i>Letters</i> an m (at least) Thicker than
the <i>Patterns</i> were made, for the <i>Steel-Punches</i> to
be Forged to a size by.</p>

<p>In the Forging of these <i>Copper-Rods</i>, he instructs
the <i>Copper-Smith</i> to make Choice of the
softest <i>Copper</i> he can get, that the <i>Steel-Punches</i>
may run the less hazzard of breaking; and
sometimes (if too soft Temper’d) battering their
Stroaks.</p>

<p>The <i>Rose Copper</i> is commonly accounted the softest:

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>

But yet I have many times <i>Sunk Punches</i> indifferently
into every sort of <i>Copper</i>. Nay, even cast <i>Copper</i>, which
is generally accounted the Hardest: Because <i>Copper</i>,
as well (as some other Mettals) Hardens with
Melting.</p>

<p>These <i>Rods</i> of <i>Copper</i> are (as I told you in §. III.
¶. 1.) to be Cut into small Lengths, each about an
Inch and an half long, and a <i>Great-Primmer</i> or
<i>Double-Pica</i> deep; and for great Bodyed <i>Letters</i> a
<i>Two-lin’d-English</i> deep; But their Thickness not
assignable, because of the Different Thicknesses in
<i>Letters</i>, both of the same and other <i>Bodies</i>, as in part
I shewed, in §. II. and more fully in this present §.
and ¶.</p>

<p>The reason why the <i>Copper-Rods</i> are Forg’d so
deep, is, That the more substance of <i>Copper</i> may
lie under the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i>: For if the <i>Rod</i>
have not a convenient depth, the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i>
in <i>Sinking</i>, does the sooner ingage with the Hardness
of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Stake</i> it is <i>Sunk</i> upon: And
having with a few Blows of the <i>Hammer</i>, soon
hardned the <i>Copper</i> just under the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i>,
as well the hardness of the small (thus hardned)
<i>Body</i> of <i>Copper</i> just under the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i>, as
the Hardness of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Stake</i> contribute
a complycated assistance to the breaking or battering
the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i>. But if the <i>Rod</i> be deep,
the Substance of <i>Copper</i> between the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i>
and the <i>Stake</i> is less hardned, and consequently the
<i>Punch</i> will <i>Sink</i> the easier, and deeper with less
Violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>But sometimes it has happ’ned that for the <i>Sinking</i>
one <i>Matrice</i> or two, I have been loath to trouble
my self to go to the <i>Copper-Smiths</i>, to get one
Forg’d: and therefore I have made shift with such
<i>Copper</i> as I have had by me. But when it has not
been so deep as I could have wisht it, I have just entred
the <i>Punch</i> into the <i>Matrice</i> upon the <i>Stake</i>, and
to <i>Sink</i> it deep enough, I have laid it upon a good
thick piece of <i>Lead</i>, which by reason of its softness
has not hardned the <i>Copper</i> just under the <i>Face</i> of the
<i>Punch</i>; but suffered the <i>Punch</i> to do its <i>Office</i> with
good Success.</p>

<p>Having cut the <i>Copper-Rods</i>, into fit Lengths with
a Cold <i>Chissel</i>, He files the end that is to stand
upon the <i>Stool</i> of the <i>Mold</i> exactly square, and the
Right-side of the <i>Matrice</i>, that stands against the
<i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>, also exactly Square and smooth
upon the <i>Using-File</i>. Then he places the filed end,
or <i>Bottom</i> upon the <i>Stool</i>, with the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>
towards the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>, and the Right
side of the <i>Matrice</i>, close against the <i>Register</i>: Then
if the <i>Punch</i> to be sunck be an ascending Letter. He
with a fine pointed <i>Needle</i>, makes a small Race by
the upper-side of the <i>Carriage</i> upon the <i>Face</i> of the
<i>Matrice</i>, and that Race is a mark for him, to set the
top of the Ascending <i>Letter</i> at, when he <i>Sinks</i> it into
the <i>Matrice</i>: So that then placing the <i>Punch</i> upright
upon the middle of the Thickness of the <i>Matrice</i>,
the <i>Matrice</i> lying solid on the <i>Stake</i>: He with
the <i>Face</i> of an <i>Hammer</i> sizable to the bigness of
his <i>Punch</i>, cautiously knocks upon the <i>Hammer-end</i>
of the <i>Punch</i>, with reiterated Blows, till

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>

he have driven the <i>Punch</i> deep enough into the
<i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<p>But if it be a short <i>Letter</i>, or a Descending <i>Letter</i>,
and not Ascending also: Then he elects any
<i>Cast-Letter</i> of the Thickness of the <i>Beard</i>, (as <i>Founders</i>
and <i>Printers</i> call it) For which Explanation
see the Table, and he lays that <i>Letter</i> upon the <i>Surface</i>
of the <i>Carriage</i>, and then placing the <i>Bottom</i>
of the <i>Matrice</i> to be <i>Sunk</i> as before, on the <i>Stool</i>,
and against the <i>Register</i>, He draws with a <i>Needle</i>
as before, a race above the <i>Surface</i> of that <i>Letter</i>,
against the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, and that race is a
Mark for him to place the <i>Head</i> of the <i>Letter</i> by.
Then managing the <i>Punch</i> and <i>Hammer</i> as before
was shewed, he <i>Sinks</i> the <i>Punch</i> into the <i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<p>But here arises a Question, <i>viz.</i> How deep the
<i>Punches</i> are to be <i>Sunk</i> into the <i>Matrices</i>? The
Answer is, a Thick <i>Space</i> deep, though deeper even
to an n would be yet better: Because the deeper the
<i>Punches</i> are <i>Sunk</i>, the lower does the <i>Beards</i> stand
below the <i>Face</i>, and those <i>Beards</i> when the <i>Cast
Letter</i> comes into the <i>Printers</i> Hands to be used, are
the less subject to <i>Print</i>, as too oft they do both at
<i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i> of a <i>Page</i>, than when they lie so high
that the softness of the <i>Blankets</i>, and Hardness of a
<i>Pull</i>, or else carelesness of Running the <i>Carriage</i> of
the <i>Press</i> to a considered Mark they would be. But
they are seldom <i>Sunk</i> any deeper then a thick Space:
and the reason is, because the breaking or battering
the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i> should not be too much hazarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>The many <i>Punches</i> to be <i>Sunk</i> into <i>Matrices</i> for
the same <i>Body</i>, are difficult to be <i>Sunk</i> of an equal
depth. Therefore I always make a <i>Beard-Gage</i>, as is
described in <i>Plate</i> 19 at F, where <i>a b</i> is a <i>Sholder</i>
that rests upon the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, <i>c</i> is the
<i>Point</i> or <i>Gage</i> that measures the depth of the <i>Sunken
Punch</i>. So that when the <i>Point</i> <i>c</i> just touches
the <i>Bottom</i>, and both the <i>Sholders</i> <i>a b</i> the <i>Face</i>
of the <i>Matrice</i>, the <i>Punch</i> may be accounted well
Sunk as to depth.</p>

<p>But though it be accounted well <i>Sunk</i> for a
first Essay, yet can it not be reasonably imagined
it is well <i>Sunk</i> for good and all; as well because in
<i>Sinking</i> the <i>Punches</i> it has carryed some part of
the <i>Surface</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> down below the <i>Face</i> of
the <i>Matrice</i> into the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Copper</i>, as because
both the <i>Sides</i> are doubtless extorted, and one Side
or Part of the <i>Punch Sunk</i> more or less deeper than
the other. Wherefore I now come to</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Justifying the</i> Matrices.</h4>

<p><i>Justifying</i> of <i>Matrices</i> is, 1. to make the <i>Face</i> of
the <i>Sunken</i> Letter, lie an exact designed depth below
the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, and on all its sides
equally deep from the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>. 2. It is
to set or <i>Justifie</i> the <i>Foot-line</i> of the Letter exactly
in <i>Line</i>. 3. It is to <i>Justifie</i> both the sides, <i>viz.</i>
the Right and left sides of a <i>Matrice</i> to an exact
thickness.</p>

<p>Therefore to proceed Methodically, he first slightly
Files down the <i>Bunchings</i> out that the <i>Punch</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>

made in the Sides of the <i>Matrice</i>; And then slightly
Files down all the <i>Copper</i>, on the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>,
till the Hollow the <i>Punch</i> made becomes even
with the whole <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<p>Then he <i>Casts</i> a <i>Proof-Letter</i> or two, and <i>Rubs</i>
them: And with the Edge of a Knife cuts out
what may remain in the bottom of the <i>Shanck</i>
by reason of the un-even breaking, off of the
<i>Break</i> that the square bottom of the <i>Shanck</i> may
not be born off the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i> of the <i>Lining-Stick</i>.</p>

<p>But having till now said nothing of the <i>Lining-Stick</i>,
it is proper before I proceed, to give a Description
of it: It is delineated in <i>Plate</i> 19 at G.
Where G is the <i>Plain</i>, <i>a</i> the <i>Side-Ledge</i>, <i>b</i> the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i>,
<i>c</i> the <i>Stilt</i>, all made of <i>Brass</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Plain</i> is exactly flat, Straight, and Smooth, that
the <i>Shancks</i> of the <i>Letter</i> being likewise so, may lie
flat and solidly on it. Its depth between the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i>,
and the fore edge is about the length of the
<i>Shanck</i> of the Letter: But the whole <i>Plain</i> of <i>Brass</i>
is yet deeper; Because the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i> is fastned
on it. The <i>Lining-Stick</i> is about two <i>Inches</i>
long for small Letters; but longer for Big-<i>Bodyed</i>
<i>Letters</i>.</p>

<p>Both <i>Bottom</i> and <i>Side-Ledge</i>, is a thin piece of <i>Brass</i>,
from a <i>Scaboard</i> to a <i>Pica</i> thick, according as the <i>Body</i>
whose <i>Face</i> and <i>Foot-line</i> is to be <i>Justified</i> in it is
bigger or less. These two <i>Ledges</i> is an Inside Square
exactly wrought, and with small <i>Rivets</i> fastned on
the <i>Side</i> edge, and on the <i>Bottom</i> edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Stilt</i> is a thin flat piece of <i>Brass-Plate</i> about
a <i>Scaboard</i> thick, and a <i>Double-Pica</i> broad:
One of its edges is <i>Soldered</i> to the under-side of
the <i>Plain</i>, about a <i>Double-Pica</i> within the fore-edge
of the <i>Plain</i>, that the <i>Lining-Stick</i> (when set
by with <i>Proof-Letters</i> in it) may not lie flat on
its <i>Bottom</i>; but have its fore edge <i>Tilted</i> up, that
the <i>Letters</i> in it may rest against the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i>.</p>

<p>Having cut the <i>Notch</i> in the <i>Break</i> of the <i>Letters</i>
as aforesaid, He <i>Rubs</i> every side of them on the
<i>Stone</i>, with two or three hard <i>Rubs</i>, to take off the
small <i>Rags</i> that may happen on the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i>,
notwithstanding the <i>Mold</i> is imagined to be very truly
made and <i>Justified</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Stone</i> is commonly a whole <i>Grind-Stone</i>, about
eighteen Inches diameter, having both its sides truly
<i>Rub’d</i> flat and smooth, by <i>Jostling</i> it (as <i>Masons</i>
call it) upon another broad long and flat Stone
with <i>Sand</i> and <i>Water</i>. It must have a fine, but very
sharp <i>Greet</i>. Now to return.</p>

<p>He places a Quadrat of the same <i>Body</i>, on the
<i>Plain</i> of the <i>Lining-stick</i>, and against the <i>Side-Ledge</i>
of it He sets up three or four old m’s of the same
<i>Body</i>: Then sets up his <i>Proof-Letter</i> or <i>Letters</i>, and
after his <i>Proof-Letter</i> three or four old m’s more of
the same <i>Body</i>; and being very careful that the <i>Foot</i>
of the <i>Shanck</i> of the Letter stands full down against
the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i> of the <i>Lining-stick</i>, He applies the
edge of the <i>Liner</i> to the <i>Faces</i> of all these Letters:
And if he finds that the edge of the <i>Liner</i> just touch
(and no more) as well all the parts of his <i>Proof-Letters</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>

as they do upon his old <i>Letters</i>, He concludes
his <i>Matrice</i> is <i>Sunk</i> to a true <i>Height against
Paper</i>.</p>

<p>But he seldom hopes for so good luck; but does
more likely expect the <i>Matrice</i> is <i>Sunk</i> too deep or
too shallow, and awry on the right and left side,
or on the top or bottom of the <i>Line</i>, for all or any
of these Faults the <i>Liner</i> will easily discover. Therefore
I shall shew you how he <i>Justifies</i> a <i>Matrice</i> that is
too <i>High against Paper</i>.</p>

<p>We will suppose the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Punch</i> is <i>Sunk</i>
flat and straight down into the <i>Matrice</i>; but yet it
is a little too deep <i>Sunk</i>. Therefore he considers
how much it is too deep: If it be but a little too deep,
perhaps when the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> shall be made
exactly flat (for yet it is but <i>Rough-Filed</i>) it may
be wrought down to be just of an <i>Height against Paper</i>.
But if the <i>Punch</i> be <i>Sunk</i> so much too deep
that the smoothing the flat of the <i>Face</i> on the <i>Using-File</i>
will not work it low enough; then with a
<i>Bastard-cut flat-File</i>, he takes off (according to his
Discretion) so much <i>Copper</i> from the <i>Face</i> of the
<i>Matrice</i> as will make it so much nearer as he thinks
it wants to the <i>Face</i> of the Letter. But yet considers
that the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> is yet to smoothen on
the <i>Using-File</i>, and therefore he is careful not to
take too much off the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> with the
<i>Rough-File</i>.</p>

<p>He is also very careful that when he is to <i>File</i> upon
the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, to <i>Screw</i> the <i>Face</i> of it
Horizontally flat in the <i>Vice</i>: And that in <i>Filing</i>
upon it, he keeps his <i>File</i> directly Horizontal, as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>

was shewed, <i>Numb.</i> 1. <i>Fol.</i> 15, 16. <i>Vol.</i> 1. For if
he let his right or left hand dip, the <i>File</i> will in
its Natural Progress take too much off the side it dips
upon, and consequently the <i>Face</i> of the Letter on
that side will lie shallower from the <i>Face</i> of the
<i>Matrice</i> then it will on the opposite side. The like
caution he makes, in <i>Filing</i> between the <i>Top</i> and
<i>Bottom</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> on the <i>Face</i>. For if he <i>Files</i>
away too much <i>Copper</i> toward the <i>Top</i> or <i>Bottom</i>, the
<i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> on its <i>Top</i> or <i>Bottom-Line</i>, will
lie on that end shallower from the <i>Face</i> of the
<i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<p>Then he considers by his <i>Proof-Letters</i> how
much too thick the right or left side of the <i>Matrice</i>
is.</p>

<p>I told you in §. 11. ¶. 4. that the Angle the <i>Sholder</i>
made with the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, is about 100
Degrees, which is 10 Degrees more then a <i>right Angle</i>
or <i>Square</i>. So that if a <i>Letter</i> be <i>Cast</i> and <i>Rub’d</i>
just so thick that the <i>Liner</i> when applied to the
<i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i> reaches just to the <i>Sholder</i>, there
will be an <i>Angle</i> of 10 Degrees, contained between
the edge of the <i>Liner</i> and the <i>Straight Line</i>
that proceeds from the <i>Sholder</i> at the <i>Shanck</i>, to
the outer-edge of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i>. And if two
<i>Letters</i> be thus <i>Cast</i> and <i>Rub’d</i> and <i>Set</i> together, the
<i>Angle</i> contained between their <i>Shancks</i>, and the
outer-edge of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> will be 20 Degrees,
which is too wide by half for the <i>Faces</i> of two
<i>Letters</i> to stand assunder. Therefore the sides of the
<i>Matrice</i> must be so <i>Justified</i>, that when the <i>Shancks</i>
of two <i>Letters</i> stand close together, the <i>Angle</i> between

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>

both the <i>Shancks</i>, and the adjacent outer-edges
of the <i>Faces</i> of the <i>Letters</i> may both make
an <i>Angle</i> of about 10 Degrees as aforesaid, which
is a convenient distance for two <i>Letters</i> to stand
assunder at the <i>Face</i>. But to do which, If the right-side
be too thick, the <i>Register</i> of the under-half of
the <i>Mold</i>, being (as I said) hard screw’d, so as to stand
about an n off the edge of the <i>Body</i> towards the right
hand; He places the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> on the
<i>Stool</i>, and the right-side of the <i>Matrice</i> close against
the <i>Register</i>, and observes how much too thick that
side of the <i>Matrice</i> is: For so much as the right-hand
edge of the <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> stands on the
left-hand side of the <i>Body</i>, so much is the Right-side
of the <i>Matrice</i> too thick, and must by several offers
be <i>Filed</i> away with a <i>Bastard-Cut-File</i>, not all
at once, least (ere he be aware) he makes that side of
the <i>Matrice</i> too thin, which will be a great dammage
to the <i>Matrice</i>, and cannot be mended but with a
<i>Botch</i>, as shall in proper place be shewed.</p>

<p>Having by several proffers wrought the right-side
of the <i>Matrice</i> thus near its thickness, he proceeds
to <i>Justifie</i> the left side also. But this side
must be <i>Justified</i> by the upper half of the <i>Mold</i>;
By turning the top of the <i>Matrice</i> downwards,
and placing the left side of it (now the right-side)
against the <i>Register</i>, and works away the
left side in all respects as he did the right-side; still
being very cautious he takes not to much <i>Copper</i> away
at once.</p>

<p>To <i>Justifie</i> the <i>Letter</i> in <i>Line</i> he examins the <i>Proof-Letter</i>
(yet standing in the <i>Lining-Stick</i>) and applies

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>

the <i>Liner</i> to the <i>Foot-line</i>: And if the <i>Liner</i> touch
all the way upon the <i>Foot-line</i> of the <i>Proof-Letter</i>
and the <i>Foot-Line</i> of all the old m’s, that <i>Matrice</i>
is <i>Justified</i> in <i>Line</i>. But this also very rarely
happens at first, for by design it is generally made
to stand too low in <i>Line</i>: Because the <i>Bottom</i> of
the <i>Matrice</i> may by several proffers be <i>Filed</i> away
till the <i>Letter</i> stand exactly in <i>Line</i>. But should
he take too much off the <i>Bottom</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>,
it cannot be made to stand lower without another
<i>Botch</i>.</p>

<p>Nor does he reckon that this first Operation, or
perhaps several more such, shall <i>Justifie</i> the <i>Matrice</i>
in <i>Line</i>. But after bringing both the sides
of the <i>Matrice</i> thus near, and also bringing the
<i>Matrice</i> thus near the <i>Line</i>. He <i>Casts</i> another <i>Proof-Letter</i>
or two, and <i>Rubbing</i> all the sides of their
<i>Shancks</i>, as before was shew’d, he tries by <i>Rubbing</i>
the <i>Letters</i> how near he has brought the thickness
of both the sides: For when the sides of the <i>Matrice</i>
are brought just to such a thickness, that the
<i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i> (<i>Cast</i> in the <i>Mold</i>) <i>Rubs</i> flat half
way up beyond the <i>Beard</i> towards the <i>Face</i> of the
<i>Letter</i>, the <i>Matrice</i> is of a convenient thickness, and
there the <i>Angle</i> from the <i>Beard</i> of the <i>Shanck</i>, to the
outer-edge of two <i>Letters</i> set together, will make an
<i>Angle</i> of about 10 degrees as aforesaid, which being
about one third part of a <i>thin Space</i> is a convenient
distance for the adjacent edges of two <i>Letters</i> to
stand assunder: But yet <i>Founders</i> sometimes to <i>Get in</i>
or <i>drive-out</i>, <i>Cast</i> the <i>Letters</i> thinner or thicker, and
consequently their <i>Faces</i> stand closer or wider assunder,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>

which is unseemly when the <i>Letter</i> comes to be
<i>Printed</i>.</p>

<p>Then he sets the <i>Proof-Letters</i> in the <i>Lining-Stick</i>,
between four or five old m’s as before, and with the
<i>Liner</i> examins again how well these <i>Proof-Letters</i>
stand in <i>Line</i> with the old m’s, which if they do
not, he Reiterates the former Operations so oft, till
the sides and <i>Line</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> is <i>Justified</i>, and at
every Operation <i>Casts</i> new <i>Proof-Letters</i> to examine
the thickness of both the Sides, and how
well the <i>Matrice</i> is <i>Justified</i> to <i>Stand in Line</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Matrice</i> being now <i>Justified</i>, he Files a <i>Leather-Groove</i>
round about it, <i>viz.</i> a <i>Notch</i> (made properest
with a three square <i>File</i>) within about a thick
<i>Scaboard</i> of the top of the <i>Matrice</i>, to tie the <i>Leather</i>
fast to.</p>

<p>He also <i>Files</i> another <i>Notch</i> in the back-side of the
<i>Matrice</i> athwart it, to rest the point of the <i>Wyer</i> or
<i>Spring</i> in. But this <i>Notch</i> must by no means be made
before the <i>Matrice</i> be <i>Justified</i> to its true <i>Height
against Paper</i>: Because when this <i>Notch</i> is made, the
<i>Punch</i> cannot again be struck in the <i>Matrice</i>; For
that the <i>Matrice</i> will not lie solid on the <i>Stake</i> in that
place.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of</i> Botching-Matrices, <i>to make them
serve the better</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Matrices</i> are sometimes either through a careless, or
sometimes through an unlucky stroak or two of the
<i>File</i> made too thin. And sometimes the <i>Foot</i> of the
<i>Matrice</i> is too much taken away, and the Letter by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>

that means stands too high in <i>Line</i>: And sometimes
the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrices</i> is too much taken away;
So that the Letter will not stand <i>High enough against
Paper</i>.</p>

<p>To remedy all or any part of these inconveniencies,
<i>Founders</i> are forced to make <i>Botches</i> on the <i>Matrice</i>:
As first, If the <i>Matrice</i> be too thin on the right
or left-ide, or both; They prick up that side, by
laying the <i>Matrice</i> flat on the <i>Work-Bench</i>, with the
thin side upwards, and holding the point of a <i>Punch-Graver</i>
aslope upon the thin side, with an <i>Hammer</i>
drive the point into the thin side of the <i>Matrice</i>, and
so raise a <i>Bur</i> upon that side; which <i>Bur</i> (though it
thicken not the <i>Matrice</i>, yet it) makes the side of the
<i>Matrice</i> stand off the <i>Register</i>, and consequently is equevalent
to thickning it.</p>

<p>The higher this <i>Bur</i> is raised, the better is the <i>Matrice
Botcht</i>; because the thin fine points thus raised
(if not pretty well flatted into the Substance of the
<i>Bur</i>) will quickly either wear off by the pressure of
the <i>Register</i> against them, or else flatten into the <i>Body</i>
of the <i>Bur</i>, and both ways makes the <i>Matrice</i> again
too thin.</p>

<p>Sometimes they do not <i>Botch</i> the <i>Matrice</i> thus for
this fault; but only Paste a piece of Paper, or a Card,
(according as it may want thickness) against the thin
side of the <i>Matrice</i> and so thicken it.</p>

<p>But to mend the sides I use another Expedient,
<i>viz.</i> by Soldering a piece of <i>Plate-Brass</i> against its
thin side or sides, which is much better than <i>Botching</i>
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, If the <i>Matrice</i> be filed away too much
at the <i>Foot</i>, they knock it up with the <i>Pen</i> of
the <i>Hammer</i>; and stretch it between the <i>Foot</i> and
the <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, and then <i>Justifie</i> it again
in <i>Line</i>. Or a piece may be <i>Soldered</i> under
the <i>Foot</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, If the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> be too much
taken away, and either the <i>Punch</i> spoiled or the
<i>Notch</i> in the back of the <i>Matrice</i> made so, as it
cannot be <i>Sunken</i> deeper, they raise a <i>Bur</i> on the
<i>Face</i>, as they did on the thin sides, to keep the
<i>Matrice</i> off the <i>Carriages</i> and <i>Bodies</i> which Lengthens
the height of the Letter <i>against Paper</i> so
much as is the height of the raised <i>Bur</i>. But of
all the <i>Botches</i> this is the worst, because the <i>Beard</i>
lies now nearer the <i>Face</i>: And the hollow standing
off of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> from the <i>Carriages</i>
and <i>Bodies</i>, subjects the Mettal to run between
them, and so pesters the Workman to get the Letter
out of the <i>Mold</i> and <i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<br>
<h3>Sect. XVIII, <i>Of setting up the</i> Furnance.</h3>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">H</span>Aving <i>Justified</i> the <i>Mold</i> and <i>Matrice</i>, we come
now to <i>Casting</i> of <i>Letters</i>: But yet we have
neither <i>Furnance</i>, <i>Mettal</i>, or <i>Ladle</i>. Wherefore it is the
<i>Founders</i> care, first to provide these.</p>

<p>The <i>Furnance</i> I have described in Plate 20. It is
built of Brick upright, with four square sides and a
Stone on the top, in which Stone is a wide round
hole for the <i>Pan</i> to stand in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><i>a b c d</i> The square Stone at the top, covering
the whole <i>Furnance</i>. This is indeed the <i>Furnance</i>.</li>
<li><i>a d</i>, <i>b c</i> The breadth two Foot and one Inch.</li>
<li><i>a b</i>, <i>c d</i> The Length two Foot three Inches. Into
the Breadth and Length about the whole Stone,
is let in even with the top of the Stone a square <i>Iron
Band</i> two Inches deep, and a quarter and half quarter
of an Inch thick to preserve the Edges of the Stone
from battering.</li>
<li><i>e</i> The round hole the Pan stands in, which hath
an <i>Iron Plate</i> let into it eight Inches diameter, an
Inch and half broad and one quarter of an Inch
thick.</li>
<li>This <i>Iron</i>-Plate fits the <i>inside</i> of the <i>Hole</i> so far as
it is Circular, and consequently is a <i>Segment</i> of a
<i>Circle</i>. But where the <i>Smoak-vent</i> breaks off the
Circularity of the Stone, there ends this Plate of <i>Iron</i>,
that the Smoak may have the freer vent. Its Office
also is to preserve the Edge of the <i>Hole</i> from battering,
with the oft taking out and putting in the <i>Iron
Pan</i>.</li>
<li><i>f</i> The <i>Funnel</i> seven Inches high, and five Inches

<li><i>k</i> The <i>Ash-Hole</i> where the Ashes that fall from the
Hearth are taken away.</li>
<li><i>l m n o</i> The <i>Bench</i> two Foot broad, three Foot
long, and two Foot eight Inches high. The <i>Bench</i>
is to empty the Letters out of the <i>Mold</i> upon, as the
<i>Founder Casts</i> them.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The <i>Hearth</i> lies seven Inches below the top of the
round <i>Hole</i>, and hath under it another round <i>Iron-Ring</i>
of the same demensions with the first, on which
straight <i>Iron-Bars</i> are fastened that the <i>Fire</i> is laid
on.</p>

<p>In the round <i>Iron-Ring</i> (or rather Segment) on the
top of the <i>Furnance</i> is set the <i>Pan</i>, which is either
a <i>Plate Ladle</i>, or a small <i>Cast-Iron Kettle</i> that sinks
into it within two Inches of the <i>Brims</i> of the
<i>Pan</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of making</i> Mettal.</h4>

<p>The Mettal <i>Founders</i> make <i>Printing-Letters</i> of, is
<i>Lead</i> hardned with <i>Iron</i>: Thus they chuse <i>stub-Nails</i>
for the best <i>Iron</i> to Melt, as well because they are asured
<i>stub-Nails</i> are made of good soft and tough <i>Iron</i>,
as because (they being in small pieces of <i>Iron</i>) will Melt
the sooner.</p>

<p>To make the <i>Iron Run</i>, they mingle an equal
weight of <i>Antimony</i> (beaten in an Iron-Morter into
small pieces) and <i>stub-Nails</i> together. And preparing
so many Earthen forty or fifty pounds <i>Melting-Pots</i>
(made for that purpose to endure the <i>Fire</i>)
as they intend to use: They <i>Charge</i> these Pots with
the mingled <i>Iron</i> and <i>Antimony</i> as full as they will
hold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Every time they Melt <i>Mettal</i>, they build a new
<i>Furnance</i> to melt it in: This <i>Furnance</i> is called an
<i>Open Furnance</i>; because the Air blows in through
all its sides to Fan the <i>Fire</i>: They make it of Bricks in a
broad open place, as well because the Air may have
free access to all its sides, as that the Vapours of the
<i>Antimony</i> (which are Obnoxious) may the less offend
those that officiate at the <i>Making</i> the <i>Mettal</i>:
And also because the Violent Fire made in the <i>Furnance</i>
should not endanger the Firing any adjacent
Houses.</p>

<p>They consider before they make the <i>Furnance</i> how
many Pots of <i>Mettal</i> they intend to Melt, and make
the <i>Furnance</i> sizable to that number: We will suppose
<i>five</i> <i>Pots</i>. Therefore they first make a Circle
on the Ground capable to hold these five <i>Pots</i>, and
wider yet by three or four Inches round about:
Then within this Circle they lay a Course of Bricks
close to one another to fill the Plain of that Platform,
with their broad or flat sides downwards, and
their ends all one way, and on this Course of Bricks
they lay another Course of Bricks as before, only
the Lengths of this Course of Bricks lies athwart
the Breadths of the other Course of Bricks: Then
they lay a third Course of Bricks with their
lengths cross the Breadth of the second Course of
Bricks.</p>

<p>Having thus raised a Platform, they place these
five <i>Pots</i> in the middle of it close to one another,
and then on the Foundation or Platform raise the
<i>Furnance</i> round about by laying the Bricks of the
first <i>Lay</i> end to end and flat, close to one another:

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>

On the second <i>Lay</i>, they place the middle of a Brick
over a <i>Joynt</i> (as <i>Brick-layers</i> call it) that is where
the ends of two Bricks joyn together, and so again
lay Bricks end to end till they <i>Trim</i> round the <i>Platform</i>.
Then they lay a third <i>Lay</i> of Bricks, covering
the <i>Joynts</i> of the second <i>Lay</i> of Bricks as before: So
is the Foundation finisht.</p>

<p>Then they raise the Walls to the <i>Furnance</i> on this
Foundation; But do not lay the ends of their Bricks
close together. But lay the ends of each Brick about
three Inches off each other, to serve for <i>Wind-holes</i>
till they <i>Trim</i> round about: Then they lay another
<i>Lay</i> of Bricks leaving other such <i>Wind-holes</i> over the
middle of the last <i>Lay</i> of Bricks, and so <i>Trim</i> as
they work round either with half Bricks or Bats that
the <i>Wind-holes</i> of the last <i>Lay</i> may be covered:
And in this manner and order they lay so many <i>Lays</i>
till the Walls of the <i>Furnance</i> be raised about three
Bricks higher than the <i>Mouths</i> of the <i>Melting-Pots</i>,
still observing to leave such <i>Wind-holes</i> over the
middle of every Brick that lies under each <i>Lay</i>.</p>

<p>Then they fill the sides of the <i>Furnance</i> round about
the <i>Melting-Pots</i>, and over them with <i>Charcoal</i>,
and <i>Fire</i> it at several <i>Wind-holes</i> in the bottom till
it burn up and all over the <i>Furnance</i>, which a moderate
Wind in about an Hours time will do: And
about half an Hours time after they lay their Ears
near the Ground and listen to hear a <i>Bubling</i> in the
<i>Pots</i>; and this they do so often till they do hear it.
When they hear this <i>Bubling</i>, they conclude the <i>Iron</i>
is melted: But yet they will let it stand, perhaps
half an hour longer or more, according as they guess

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>

the Fire to be Hotter or Cooler, that they may be
the more assured it is all throughly Melted. And
when it is Melted the Melting <i>Pot</i> will not be a quarter
full.</p>

<p>And in or against that time they make another
small <i>Furnance</i> close to the first, (to set an <i>Iron-Pot</i>
in, in which they Melt <i>Lead</i>) on that side from
whence the Wind blows; Because the Person that
Lades the <i>Lead</i> out of the <i>Iron-Pot</i> (as shall be shewed
by and by) may be the less annoyed with the
Fumes of the <i>Mettal</i>, in both <i>Furnances</i>. This <i>Furnance</i>
is made of three or four <i>Course</i> of Bricks open
to the windward, and wide enough to contain the
designed <i>Iron-Pot</i>, with room between it and the
sides to hold a convenient quantity of <i>Charcoal</i> under
it, and about it.</p>

<p>Into this <i>Iron-Pot</i> they put for every three Pound
of <i>Iron</i>, about five and twenty pounds of <i>Lead</i>. And
setting Fire to the <i>Coals</i> in this little <i>Furnance</i> they
Melt and Heat this <i>Lead</i> Red-hot.</p>

<p>Hitherto a Man (nay, a Boy) might officiate all
this Work; But now comes Labour would make
<i>Hercules</i> sweat. Now they fall to pulling down so
much of the side of the open <i>Furnance</i> as stands above
the Mouth of that <i>Melting-Pot</i> next the <i>Iron-Pot</i>,
And having a thick strong <i>Iron Ladle</i>, whose <i>Handle</i>
is about two Yards long, and the <i>Ladle</i> big enough
to hold about ten Pounds of <i>Lead</i>, and this <i>Ladle</i>
Red-hot that it chill not the <i>Mettal</i>, they now I say
with this <i>Ladle</i> fall to clearing this first <i>Melting-Pot</i>
of all the Coals or filth that lie on the top of the
Melted <i>Mettal</i>: while another Man at the same time

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>

stands provided with a long strong round <i>Iron Stirring
Poot</i>; the <i>Handle</i> of which <i>Stirring Poot</i> is also
about two Yards long or more, and the <i>Poot</i> it
self almost twice the length of the depth of the Melting
<i>Pot</i>. This <i>Poot</i> is nothing but a piece of the
same <i>Iron</i> turned to a square with the Handle:
And this <i>Poot</i> is also in a readiness heated Red-hot.</p>

<p>Now one Man with the <i>Ladle</i> <i>Lades</i> the <i>Lead</i> out
of the <i>Iron-Pot</i> into the Melting <i>Pot</i>, while the other
Man with the <i>Poot</i> stirs and Labours the <i>Lead</i>
and <i>Mettal</i> in the Melting <i>Pot</i> together till they think
the <i>Lead</i> and <i>Mettal</i> in the Melting <i>Pot</i> be well
incorporated: And thus they continue <i>Lading</i>
and <i>Stirring</i> till they have near filled the Melting
<i>Pot</i>.</p>

<p>Then they go to another next <i>Melting-Pot</i>, and
successively to all, and Lade and stir <i>Lead</i> into them
as they did into the first. Which done the <i>Mettal</i>
is made: And they pull down the <i>Walls</i> of the <i>Open
Furnance</i>, and rake away the Fire that the <i>Mettal</i> may
cool in the <i>Pots</i>.</p>

<p>Now (according to Custom) is Half a Pint of Sack
mingled with Sallad Oyl, provided for each Workman
to Drink; intended for an Antidote against
the Poysonous Fumes of the <i>Antimony</i>, and to restore
the Spirits that so Violent a Fire and Hard Labour
may have exhausted.</p>

<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of</i> Letter-Ladles.</h4>

<p><i>Letter-Ladles</i> differ nothing from other common
<i>Ladles</i>, save in the size: Yet I have given you a
Draft of one in Plate 20 at A. Of these the <i>Caster</i>
has many at Hand, and many of several sizes that
he may successively chuse one to fit the several sizes
of <i>Letters</i> he has to <i>Cast</i>; as well in <i>Bodies</i> as in
<i>Thicknesses</i>.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. XIX. ¶. 1. <i>Of</i> Casting, Breaking, Rubbing,
Kerning, <i>and setting up of</i> Letters.</h3>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">B</span>Efore the <i>Caster</i> begins to <i>Cast</i> he must kindle
his <i>Fire</i> in the <i>Furnance</i>, to <i>Melt</i> the <i>Mettal</i>
in the <i>Pan</i>. Therefore he takes the <i>Pan</i> out of
the Hole in the Stone, and there lays in <i>Coals</i> and
kindles them. And when it is well kindled, he sets
the <i>Pan</i> in again, and puts <i>Mettal</i> into it to <i>Melt</i>.
If it be a small <i>Bodyed-Letter</i> he <i>Casts</i>, or a thin <i>Letter</i>
of Great <i>Bodies</i>, his <i>Mettal</i> must be very hot; nay,
sometimes Red-hot to make the Letter <i>Come</i>. Then
having chose a <i>Ladle</i> that will hold about so much
as the <i>Letter</i> and <i>Break</i> is, he lays it at the <i>Stoking-hole</i>,
where the Flame bursts out to heat. Then he
ties a thin Leather cut into such a Figure as is described
in Plate 20 at B with its narrow end against
the <i>Face</i> to the <i>Leather-Groove</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, by
whipping a Brown Thread twice about the <i>Leather-Groove</i>,
and fastning the Thread with a Knot. Then
he puts both Halves of the <i>Mold</i> together, and puts

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>

the <i>Matrice</i> into the <i>Matrice Cheek</i>, and places the
<i>Foot</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> on the <i>Stool</i> of the <i>Mold</i>, and
the broad end of the <i>Leather</i> upon the <i>Wood</i> of the
upper half of the <i>Mold</i>, but not tight up, lest it might
hinder the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> from <i>Sinking</i> close
down upon the <i>Stool</i> in a train of Work. Then laying
a little Rosin on the upper <i>Wood</i> of the <i>Mold</i>,
and having his <i>Casting Ladle</i> hot, he with the bolling
side of it Melts the Rosin; And when it is yet
<i>Melted</i> presses the broad end of the <i>Leather</i> hard
down on the <i>Wood</i>, and so fastens it to the <i>Wood</i>. All
this is Preparation.</p>

<p>Now he comes to <i>Casting</i>. Wherefore placing the
under-half of the <i>Mold</i> in his left hand, with the <i>Hook</i>
or <i>Hag</i> forward, he clutches the ends of its <i>Wood</i>
between the lower part of the <i>Ball</i> of his Thumb
and his three hind-Fingers. Then he lays the upper
half the <i>Mold</i> upon the under-half, so as the
<i>Male-Gages</i> may fall into the <i>Female-Gages</i>, and at
the same time the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> place it self
upon the <i>Stool</i>. And clasping his left-hand Thumb
strong over the upper half of the <i>Mold</i>, he nimbly
catches hold of the <i>Bow</i> or <i>Spring</i> with his right-hand
Fingers at the top of it, and his Thumb under
it, and places the point of it against the middle of
the <i>Notch</i> in the back-side of the <i>Matrice</i>, pressing it
as well forwards towards the <i>Mold</i>, as downwards
by the <i>Sholder</i> of the <i>Notch</i> close upon the <i>Stool</i>,
while at the same time with his hinder-Fingers as aforesaid,
he draws the under-half of the <i>Mold</i> towards
the <i>Ball</i> of his Thumb, and thrusts by the
<i>Ball</i> of his Thumb the upper part towards his Fingers,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>

that both the <i>Registers</i> of the <i>Mold</i> may press
against both sides of the <i>Matrice</i>, and his Thumb
and Fingers press both Halves of the <i>Mold</i> close
together.</p>

<p>Then he takes the Handle of his <i>Ladle</i> in his right
Hand, and with the <i>Boll</i> of it gives a stroak two or
three outwards upon the <i>Surface</i> of the <i>Melted Mettal</i>
to scum or clear it from the Film or Dust that
may swim upon it. Then takes up the <i>Ladle</i> full
of <i>Mettal</i>, and having his <i>Mold</i> as aforesaid in his
left hand, he a little twists the left side of his <i>Body</i>
from the <i>Furnance</i>, and brings the <i>Geat</i> of his <i>Ladle</i>
(full of <i>Mettal</i>) to the <i>Mouth</i> of the <i>Mold</i>,
and twists the upper part of his right-hand towards
him to turn the <i>Mettal</i> into it, while at the same
moment of Time he Jilts the <i>Mold</i> in his left hand
forwards to receive the <i>Mettal</i> with a strong <i>Shake</i>
(as it is call’d) not only into the <i>Bodies</i> of the <i>Mold</i>,
but while the <i>Mettal</i> is yet hot, running swift and
strongly into the very <i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> to receive
its perfect Form there, as well as in the
<i>Shanck</i>.</p>

<p>Then he takes the upper half of the <i>Mold</i> off the
under-half, by placing his right-Hand Thumb on the
end of the <i>Wood</i> next his left-Hand Thumb, and his
two middle-Fingers at the other end of the <i>Wood</i>,
and finding the Letter and <i>Break</i> lie in the under-Half
of the <i>Mold</i> (as most commonly by reason of
its weight it does) he throws or tosses the Letter
<i>Break</i> and all upon a Sheet of Waste-Paper laid for
that purpose on the <i>Bench</i> just a little beyond his left hand,
and is then ready to <i>Cast</i> another Letter as before,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>

and also the whole number that is to be <i>Cast</i>
with that <i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<p>But sometimes it happens that by a <i>Shake</i>, or too
big a <i>Ladle</i>, the Mettal may spill or slabber over the
<i>Mouth</i> of the upper Half of the <i>Mold</i>, so that the
spilt <i>Mettal</i> sticking about the outsides of the <i>Mouth</i>,
may lift the Letter off the under-half of the <i>Mold</i>, and
keep it in the upper half. Therefore he with the
point of the <i>Hag</i> in the Wood of the under-half of
the <i>Mold</i>, picks at the hollow in the fore part of the
<i>Break</i> made by the <i>Shaking</i> out of the <i>Mettal</i>, and
draws <i>Break</i> and <i>Letter</i> both out. It sometimes sticks
in the under-half of the <i>Mold</i> by the same cause,
and then he uses the point of the <i>Hag</i> in the
upper half of the <i>Mold</i>, to pick or hale it out, as
before.</p>

<p>It also sometimes sticks when any of the Joynts
of the <i>Mold</i> open never so little, the <i>Mettal</i> thus getting
in between those Joynts: But this fault is not to
be indured, for before he can <i>Cast</i> any more, this fault
must be mended.</p>

<p>But besides <i>Letters</i>, there is to be <i>Cast</i> for a perfect
<i>Fount</i> (properly a Fund) <i>Spaces</i> Thick and Thin,
n <i>Quadrats</i>, m <i>Quadrats</i> and <i>Quadrats</i>. These are
not <i>Cast</i> with <i>Matrices</i> but with <i>Stops</i> (as we may
call them) Because when these are <i>Cast</i> they are all
shorter than the <i>Shanck</i> of the Letter, that they may
not <i>Print</i>. Therefore they take off the <i>Register</i> of
the under-Half <i>Mold</i>, and fit a piece of <i>Plate-Brass</i>
about a <i>Brevier</i> Thick and a <i>Brevier</i> longer than to
reach to the edge of the <i>Body</i> in the place of the <i>Register</i>,
and drill a hole in this <i>Plate-Brass</i> right against

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>

the Hole in the <i>Carriage</i> that the <i>Female-Screw</i> lies
in: This Hole is made so wide that the <i>Male-Screw</i>
which screwed the <i>Register</i> close to the <i>Carriage</i> and
<i>Body</i> may enter in at it, and screw this <i>Plate-Brass</i>
close to them, as it did the <i>Register</i>: Then they make
a mark with the point of a <i>Needle</i> on the <i>Plate-Brass</i>
just against the side of the Edge of the <i>Body</i>, and at
this mark they double down the end of the <i>Plate-Brass</i>
inwards to make a perfect <i>Square</i> with the <i>inside</i>
of the whole <i>Plate</i>. This doubling down is called
the <i>Stop</i> aforesaid, and must be made just so thick
as they design the Thin or Thick <i>Space</i> to be, and
must have its Upper and Under-Edges filed so exactly
to the <i>Body</i>, that it may lie close upon the
Under-<i>Carriage</i>, and just even so high as the upper-side
of the <i>Body</i>. So that when the Upper half of
the <i>Mold</i> is placed on the under-Half, and <i>Mettal
Cast</i> in at the <i>Mouth</i> (as before) the <i>Mettal</i> shall descend
no deeper between the two <i>Bodies</i> then just
to his <i>Stop</i>: You must note that this <i>Stop</i> must be
filed exactly true as to <i>Body</i> and <i>Thickness</i>: For if
it be never so little too big in <i>Body</i>, the <i>Carriage</i> of
the <i>Mold</i> will ride upon it and make the <i>Body</i> of
the <i>Space</i> bigger. Or if the <i>Body</i> be never so little
too little, the Hot <i>Mettal</i> will run beyond the <i>Stop</i>;
both which Miscarriages in making the <i>Stop</i>, spoil the
<i>Space</i>.</p>

<p>If the <i>Space</i> be too short, they File the end of the
<i>Stop</i> shorter.</p>

<p>This <i>Brevier</i> thick <i>Plate</i> will be thick enough for
<i>Stops</i> for the Thin or Thick <i>Spaces</i> of any Body
though of <i>Great-Cannon</i>, and for the n <i>Quadrat Stop</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>

of any Body under a <i>Great Primmer</i>. And for the
m <i>Quadrat Stop</i> of all to a <i>Brevier</i> and all Bodies under
it. But for <i>Stops</i> that require to be Thicker
then a <i>Brevier</i>, instead of doubling the <i>Stop</i> inwards
on the <i>Plate</i>, I <i>Solder</i> on the inside of that end of
the <i>Plate</i> a <i>Stop</i> full big enough in Body, and big
enough in Thickness for the <i>Quadrat</i> I intend to
make, and afterwards file and fit the <i>Stop</i> exactly as
before.</p>

<p>When they <i>Cast</i> these <i>Spaces</i> or <i>Quadrats</i>, this <i>Stop</i>
is always screwed fast upon the <i>Carriage</i> of the under-Half
<i>Mold</i> as aforesaid. So that they only fit
the upper half <i>Mold</i> on the under, and <i>Cast</i> their
Number almost twice as quick as they do the Letters
in <i>Matrices</i>.</p>

<p>It is generally observed by <i>Work-men</i> as a Rule,
That when they <i>Cast Quadrats</i> they <i>Cast</i> them exactly
to the Thickness of a set Number of m’s or <i>Body</i>,
<i>viz.</i> two m’s thick, three m’s thick, four m’s thick,
<i>&amp;c.</i> And therefore the <i>Stops</i> aforesaid must all be
filed exactly to their several intended thicknesses,
The reason is, that when the <i>Compositer</i> Indents any
Number of Lines, he may have <i>Quadrats</i> so exactly
<i>Cast</i> that he shall not need to <i>Justifie</i> them either with
<i>Spaces</i> or other helps.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Some Rules and Circumstances to be observed in</i><br>
Casting.</h4>

<p>1. If the Letter be a small <i>Body</i>, it requires a
Harder <i>Shake</i> than a great <i>Body</i> does: Or if it be
a thin Letter though of a greater <i>Body</i>, especially

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>

small <i>i</i>, being a thin Letter its Tittle will hardly <i>Come</i>;
So that sometimes the <i>Caster</i> is forced to put a little
<i>Block-Tin</i> into his Mettal, which makes the Mettal
Thinner, and consequently have a freer flux to the
<i>Face</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>.</p>

<p>2. He often examines the <i>Registers</i> of the <i>Mold</i>,
by often <i>Rubbing</i> a <i>Cast</i> Letter: For notwithstanding
the <i>Registers</i> were carefully <i>Justified</i> before,
and hard screwed up; yet the constant thrusting
of both <i>Registers</i> against the sides of the <i>Matrice</i>,
may and often do force them more or less to drive
backwards. Or a fall of one half or both Halfs of
the <i>Mold</i>, may drive them backwards or forwards:
Therefore he examins, as I said, how they <i>Rub</i>, whether
too Thick or too Thin. And if he see Cause, mends
the <i>Registers</i>, as I shew’d §. 5. ¶. 2.</p>

<p>Or if the <i>Matrice</i> be <i>Botcht</i>, as I shew’d you §. 5.
¶. 3. then those <i>Botches</i> (being only so many fine
points rising out of the Body of the <i>Copper</i> of the
<i>Matrice</i>) may with so many reiterated pressures of
the <i>Registers</i> against them, flatten more and more,
and press towards the Body of the <i>Matrice</i>, and consequently
make the Letter Thinner: Which if it do,
this must be mended in the <i>Matrice</i> by re-raising it to
its due Thickness.</p>

<p>3. He pretty often examins, as I shew’d in §. 5.
¶. 2. how the Letters stand in <i>Line</i>: For when great
Numbers are <i>Cast</i> with one <i>Matrice</i>, partly by pressing
the point of the <i>Wyer</i> against the <i>Bottom-Sholder</i>
of the <i>Notch</i> in the back-side of the <i>Matrice</i>, and
partly by the softness of the matter of his <i>Matrice</i> and
hardness of the <i>Iron-stool</i>, the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Matrice</i> (if

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>

it wear not) may batter so much as to put the Letter
out of Line. This must be mended with a <i>Botch</i>,
<i>viz.</i> by knocking up the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Matrice</i>, as I
shew’d §. 5. ¶. 3.</p>

<p>A Workman will <i>Cast</i> about four thousand of these
Letters ordinarily in one day.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of</i> Breaking <i>off</i> Letters.</h4>

<p><i>Breaking</i> off is commonly Boys-work: It is only
to <i>Break</i> the <i>Break</i> from the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i>.
All the care in it is, that he take up the <i>Letter</i> by its
Thickness, not its <i>Body</i> (unless its Thickness be equal
to its Body) with the fore-inger and Thumb of
his right Hand as close to the <i>Break</i> as he can, lest if
when the <i>Break</i> be between the fore-Finger and
Thumb of his left hand, the force of <i>Breaking</i>
off the <i>Break</i> should bow the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of</i> Rubbing <i>of</i> Letters.</h4>

<p><i>Rubbing</i> of <i>Letters</i> is also most commonly Boys-work:
But when they do it, they provide <i>Finger-stalls</i>
for the two fore-Fingers of the right-Hand:
For else the Skin of their Fingers would quickly rub
off with the sharp greet of the Stone. These <i>Finger-stalls</i>
are made of old <i>Ball-Leather</i> or <i>Pelts</i>
that <i>Printers</i> have done with: Then having an heap
of one sort of <i>Letters</i> lying upon the Stone before
them, with the left hand they pick up the <i>Letter</i> to
be <i>Rub’d</i>, and lay it down in the <i>Rubbing</i> place with

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>

one of its sides upwards they clap the Balls of the
fore-Finger and middle-Finger upon the fore and
hinder-ends of the <i>Letter</i>, and <i>Rubbing</i> the <i>Letter</i>
pretty lightly backwards about eight or nine Inches,
they bring it forwards again with an hard pressing
<i>Rub</i> upon the <i>Stone</i>; where the fore-Finger
and Thumb of the left-Hand is ready to receive
it, and quickly turn the opposite side of the <i>Letter</i>,
to take such a <i>Rub</i> as the other side had.</p>

<p>But in <i>Rubbing</i> they are very careful that they
press the Balls of their Fingers equally hard on
the <i>Head</i> and <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Letter</i>. For if the <i>Head</i>
and <i>Foot</i> be not equally prest on the <i>Stone</i>, either
the <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i> will <i>drive-out</i> when the <i>Letters</i> come
to be <i>Composed</i> in the <i>Stick</i>; So that without <i>Rubbing</i>
over again they cannot be <i>Drest</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Of</i> Kerning <i>of</i> Letters.</h4>

<p>Amongst the <i>Italick-Letters</i> many are to be <i>Kern’d</i>,
some only on one side, and some both sides. The
<i>Kern’d-Letters</i> are such as have part of their <i>Face</i>
hanging over one side or both sides of their <i>Shanck</i>:
These cannot be <i>Rub’d</i>, because part of the <i>Face</i>
would <i>Rub</i> away when the whole side of the <i>Shanck</i>
is toucht by the <i>Stone</i>: Therefore they must be <i>Kern’d</i>,
as <i>Founders</i> call it: Which to do, they provide
a small Stick bigger or less, according as the <i>Body</i> of
the <i>Letter</i> that is to be <i>Kern’d</i>. This <i>Kerning-stick</i>
is somewhat more than an Handful long, and
it matters not whether it be square or round:
But if it be square the Edges of it must be pretty

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>

well rounded away, lest with long usage and hard
Cutting they Gall the Hand. The upper-side of this
<i>Kerning-Stick</i> is flatted away somewhat more than
the length of the <i>Letter</i>, and on that flat part is
cut away a flat bottom with two square sides like
the <i>Sides</i> or <i>Ledges</i> of the <i>Lining-stick</i> to serve for
two <i>Sholders</i>. That side to be <i>Kern’d</i> and <i>scrap’d</i>, is
laid upwards, and its opposite side on the bottom of
the <i>Kerning-stick</i> with the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Letter</i> against
the bottom <i>Sholder</i>, and the side of the <i>Letter</i> against
the side <i>Sholder</i> of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>.</p>

<p>He also provides a <i>Kerning-Knife</i>: This is a pretty
strong piece of a broken Knife, about three Inches
long, which he fits into a Wooden-Handle: But
first he breaks off the Back of the Knife towards the
Point, so as the whole edge lying in a straight line
the piece broken off from the back to the edge may
leave an angle at the point of about 45 Degrees,
which irregular breaking (for so we must suppose
it) he either <i>Grinds</i> or <i>Rubs</i> off on a <i>Grind-stone</i>.
Then he takes a piece of a Broom-stick for his Handle,
and splits one end of it about two Inches long
towards the other end, and the split part he either
Cuts or Rasps away about a <i>Brevier</i> deep round about
that end of the Handle. Then he puts about
an Inch and an half of his broken blade into the
split or slit in the Handle, and ties a four or five
doubled Paper a little below the Rasped part of
the Handle round about it, to either a <i>Pica</i> or
<i>Long-Primmer</i> thick of the slit end of the Handle.
This <i>Paper</i> is so ordered that all its sides
round about shall stand equally distant from all

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>

the Rasped part of the Handle: For then setting
the other end of the Handle in Clay, or otherwise
fastening it upright, when <i>Mettal</i> is poured
in between the Rasped part of the Handle and
the Paper about it, that <i>Mettal</i> will make a strong
<i>Ferril</i> to the <i>Handle</i> of the <i>Knife</i>. The irregularities
that may happen in <i>Casting</i> this <i>Ferril</i>
may be Rasped away to make it more handy and
Handsome.</p>

<p>Now to return again where I left off. Holding
the Handle of the <i>Kerning-stick</i> in his left hand,
He lays the side of the <i>Letter</i> to be <i>Kern’d</i> upwards
with the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> towards the
end of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>: the side of the <i>Letter</i>
against the side <i>Sholder</i> of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>, and
the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Letter</i> against the bottom <i>Sholder</i>
of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>, and laying the end of the
Ball of his left-Hand Thumb hard upon the <i>Shanck</i>
of the <i>Letter</i> to keep its <i>Side</i> and <i>Foot</i> steddy
against the <i>Sholders</i> of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>, he with
the <i>Kerning-Knife</i> in his right-Hand cuts off about
one quarter of the <i>Mettal</i> between the <i>Beard</i> of
the <i>Shanck</i> and the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i>. Then turning
his <i>Knife</i> so as the back of it may lean towards
him, he scrapes towards him with the edge of
the <i>Knife</i> about half the length of that upper-side,
<i>viz.</i> about so much as his Thumb does not cover:
Then he turns the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> against the
lower <i>Sholder</i> of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>, and scraping
fromwards him with a stroak or two of his <i>Knife</i>
smoothens that end of the <i>Letter</i> also.</p>

<p>If the other side of the <i>Letter</i> be not to be <i>Kern’d</i>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>

it was before <i>Rub’d</i> on the <i>Stone</i>, as was shewed
in the last ¶: But if it be to be <i>Kern’d</i>, then he
makes a little hole in his <i>Kerning-stick</i>, close to the
lower <i>Sholder</i> of it and full deep enough to receive
all that part of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> that hangs over
the <i>Shanck</i>, that the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i> may lie
flat and solid on the bottom of the <i>Kerning-stick</i>,
and that so the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Letter</i> bow not when
the weight of the hand presses the edge of the
<i>Kerning-Knife</i> hard upon it. Into this hole he puts
(as before said) so much of the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i>
as hangs over the side of the <i>Shanck</i>, and so
scrapes the lower end of the <i>Letter</i> and <i>Kerns</i>
the upper end, as he did the former side of the
<i>Letter</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 6. <i>Of</i> Setting up, <i>or</i> Composing Letters.</h4>

<p>I described in §. 5. ¶. 2. the <i>Lining-stick</i>, But
now we are come to <i>Setting up</i>, or <i>Composing</i> of
<i>Letters</i>. The <i>Founder</i> must provide many <i>Composing-Sticks</i>;
five or six dozen at the least. These
<i>Composing-sticks</i> are indeed but long <i>Lining-sticks</i>,
about seven or eight and twenty Inches long <i>Handle</i>
and all: Whereof the <i>Handle</i> is about three
Inches and an half long: But as the <i>Lining-stick</i>
I described was made of <i>Brass</i>: So these <i>Composing-sticks</i>
are made of <i>Beech-Wood</i>.</p>

<p>When the Boy <i>Sets</i> up <i>Letters</i> (for it is commonly
Boys-Work) The <i>Caster Casts</i> about an hundred
<i>Quadrats</i> of the same <i>Body</i> about half an Inch
broad at least, let the <i>Body</i> be what it will, and of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>

the length of the whole <i>Carriage</i>, only by placing
a flat <i>Brass</i> or <i>Iron Plate</i> upon the <i>Stool</i> of the <i>Mold</i>
close against the <i>Carriage</i> and <i>Body</i>, to stop the <i>Mettal</i>
from running farther.</p>

<p>The Boy (I say) takes the <i>Composing-stick</i> by
the <i>Handle</i> in his left hand, clasping it about
with his four Fingers, and puts the <i>Quadrat</i> first
into the <i>Composing-stick</i>, and lays the Ball of his
Thumb upon it, and with the fore-Finger and Thumb
of his right-Hand, assisted by his middle-Finger to
turn the <i>Letter</i> to a proper position, with its <i>Nick</i> upwards
towards the bottom side of the <i>Composing-stick</i>;
while it is coming to the <i>Stick</i>, he at the same time
lifts up the Thumb of his left-Hand, and with it receives
and holds the <i>Letter</i> against the fore-side of
the <i>Quadrat</i>, and after it, all the <i>Letters</i> of the same
sort, if the <i>Stick</i> will hold them, If not he <i>Sets</i> them
in so many <i>Sticks</i> as will hold them: Observing to
<i>Set</i> all the <i>Nicks</i> of them upwards, as aforesaid.
And as he <i>Set</i> a <i>Quadrat</i> at the beginning of the
<i>Composing-stick</i>, so he fills not his <i>Stick</i> so full, but
that he may <i>Set</i> another such <i>Quadrat</i> at the end
of it.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 7. <i>Some Rules and Circumstances to be observed in</i>
Setting <i>up</i> Letters.</h4>

<p>1. If they <i>Drive</i> a little out at <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i>, so
little as not to require new <i>Rubbing</i> again, then
he holds his Thumb harder against the <i>Head</i> or <i>Foot</i>,
so as to draw the <i>Driving</i> end inward: For else when
they come to <i>Scraping</i>, and <i>Dressing</i> the <i>Hook</i> of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>

<i>Dressing-Hook</i> drawing Square, will endanger the
middle or some other part of <i>Letters</i> in the <i>Stick</i>
to <i>Spring</i> out: And when they come into the <i>Dressing-block</i>,
the <i>Knots</i> of the <i>Blocks</i> drawing also
square subject them to the same inconvenience. And
if they <i>Drive</i> out at the <i>Head</i>, the <i>Feet</i> will more or
less stand off one another: So that when the <i>Tooth</i>
of the <i>Plow</i> comes to <i>Dress</i> the <i>Feet</i>, it will more or
less job against every <i>Letter</i>, and be apt to make a
bowing at the <i>Feet</i>, or at least make a <i>Bur</i> on their
sides at the <i>Feet</i>.</p>

<p>2. When <i>Short-Letters</i> are begun to be <i>Set</i> up in a
<i>Stick</i>, the whole <i>Stick</i> must be fill’d with <i>Short-Letters</i>:
Because when they are <i>Dressing</i>, the <i>Short
Letters</i> must be <i>Bearded</i> on both sides the <i>Body</i>:
And should <i>Short-Letters</i> or <i>Ascending</i> or <i>Descending</i>
or <i>Long</i> stand together, the <i>Short</i> cannot be <i>Bearded</i>
because the <i>Stems</i> of the <i>Ascending</i> or <i>Descending</i>
or <i>Long-Letters</i> reach upon the <i>Body</i> to the <i>Beard</i>:
So that the <i>Short-Letters</i> cannot be <i>Bearded</i>, unless
the <i>Stems</i> of the other <i>Letters</i> should be scraped
off.</p>

<p>3. When <i>Long-Letters</i> are begun to be <i>Set</i> up in the
<i>Stick</i>, none but such must fill it, for the reason aforesaid.</p>

<p>4. If any <i>Letters Kern’d</i> on one side be to be
<i>Set</i> up, and the <i>Stems</i> of the same <i>Letters</i> reach
not to the opposite <i>Beard</i> as s or f, in <i>Setting</i> up
these or such like <i>Letters</i>, every next <i>Letter</i> is turned
with its <i>Nick</i> downwards, that the <i>Kern</i> of
each <i>Letter</i> may lie over the <i>Beard</i> of its next. But
then they must be all <i>Set</i> up again with a 

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>

<i>Short-Letter</i> between each, that they may be <i>Bearded</i>.</p>

<p>As every <i>Stick-full</i> is set up, he sets them by upon
the <i>Racks</i>, ready for the <i>Dresser</i> to <i>Dress</i>, as shall be
shewed in the next §.</p>

<p>The <i>Racks</i> are described in <i>Plate 21.</i> at A. They are
made of Square <i>Deal Battens</i> about seven Inches and
an half long, as at <i>a b a b a b</i>, and are at the ends <i>b
b b</i> let into two upright <i>Stiles</i>, standing about sixteen
Inches and an half assunder, and the fore-ends
of the <i>Racks</i> mounting a little, that when
<i>Sticks</i> of <i>Letters</i> is <i>Set</i> by on any two parallel
<i>Racks</i>, there may be no danger that the <i>Letters</i>
in them shall slide off forward; but their <i>Feet</i>
rest against the <i>Bottom-Ledges</i> of the <i>Composing-sticks</i>.
They set by as many of these <i>Sticks</i> with
<i>Letter</i> in them, as will stand upon one another between
every two <i>Rails</i>, and then set another pile
of <i>Sticks</i> with <i>Letter</i> in them before the first, till
the length of the <i>Rail</i> be also filled with <i>Sticks</i>
of <i>Letter</i> before one another. They set all the
<i>Sticks</i> of <i>Letters</i> with their ends even to one another
with the <i>Faces</i> of the <i>Letter</i> forwards.</p>

<p>This <i>Frame of Racks</i> is always placed near the
<i>Dressing-Bench</i>, that it may stand convenient to the
<i>Letter-Dressers</i> Hand.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 20. ¶. 1. <i>Of</i> Dressing <i>of</i> Letters.</h3>

<p class="drop-capc"><span class="smcap">T</span>Here be several Tools and Machines used to
the <i>Dressing</i> of <i>Letters</i>: And unless I should
describe them to you first, you might perhaps
in my following discourse not well understand

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>

me: Wherefore I shall begin with them: They
are as follows.</p>

<div class="p2-indent">
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>1. The <i>Dressing-Sticks</i>.</li>
<li>2. The <i>Bench</i>, <i>Blocks</i> and its Appurtenances.</li>
<li>3. The <i>Dressing-Hook</i>.</li>
<li>4. The <i>Dressing-Knife</i>.</li>
<li>5. The <i>Plow</i>.</li>
<li>6. The <i>Mallet</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Of each of these in order.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Of the</i> Dressing-Sticks.</h4>

<p>I need give no other Description of the <i>Dressing-sticks</i>,
than I did in the last §. and ¶. of the <i>Composing-Sticks</i>:
Only they are made of hard Wood, and of
greater Substance, as well because hard Wood will
work smoother than soft Wood, as because greater
Substance is less Subject to warp or shake than smaller
Substance is. And also because hard Wood is
less Subject to be penetrated by the sharpness of
the <i>Bur</i> of the <i>Mettal</i> on the <i>Letters</i> than the
soft.</p>
<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of the</i> Block-Grove, <i>and its</i> Appurtenances.</h4>

<p>The <i>Block-Grove</i> is described in <i>Plate 21. a b</i>. The
<i>Groove</i> in which the <i>Blocks</i> are laid, two Inches
deep, and seven Inches and an half wide at one end,
and seven Inches wide at the other end: One of the
<i>Cheeks</i> as <i>c</i> is three Inches and an half broad at
one end, and three Inches broad at the other
end, and the other <i>Cheek</i> three Inches broad the whole

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>

Length: The Length of these <i>Cheeks</i> are two and
twenty Inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_p184a.png" width="600" height="784" alt="Image: Plate 22.">
</div>
<div class="caption center"><span class="smcap"><i>Plate 22.</i></span>
</div>

<p>The <i>Wedge</i> <i>e f</i> is seven and twenty Inches and an
half long, two Inches broad at one end, and three
Inches and an half broad at the other end; And two
Inches deep.</p>

<p><i>g g g g</i> The <i>Bench</i> on which the <i>Dressing-Blocks</i>
are placed, are about sixteen Inches broad, and two Foot ten Inches
high from the Floor. The <i>Bench</i> hath its farther Side, and both
ends, railed about with slit-Deal about two Inches high, that the
<i>Hook</i>, the <i>Knife</i>, and <i>Plow</i>, &amp;c. fall not off
when the Workman is at Work.</p>

<p>The <i>Blocks</i> are described in <i>Plate 21</i> at a b:
They are made of hard Wood. These <i>Blocks</i> are six
and twenty Inches long, and each two Inches square.
They are <i>Male</i> and <i>Female</i>, a the <i>Male</i>, b the <i>Female</i>:
Through the whole Length of the <i>Male-Block</i>
runs a <i>Tongue</i> as at <i>a b</i>, and a <i>Groove</i> as at
<i>c d</i>, for the <i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Plow</i> to run in; This
<i>Tongue</i> is about half an Inch thick, and stands out
square from the upper and under-sides of the <i>Block</i>.
About three Inches within the ends of the <i>Block</i> is
placed a <i>Knot</i> as at <i>c c</i>: These <i>Knots</i> are small square
pieces of <i>Box-wood</i>, the one above, and the other below
the <i>Tongue</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Female Block</i> is such another <i>Block</i> as the
<i>Male Block</i>, only, instead of a <i>Tongue</i> running
through the length of it a <i>Groove</i> is made to receive
the <i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Male-Block</i>, and the <i>Knots</i> in
this <i>Block</i> are made at the contrary ends, that when
the <i>Face</i> of a <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letter</i> is placed on the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>

<i>Tongue</i> the <i>Knot</i> in the <i>Male-Block</i> stops the <i>Stick</i> of
<i>Letter</i> from sliding forwards, while the other <i>Knot</i>
in the <i>Female-Block</i> at the other end, by the knocking
of a <i>Mallet</i> on the end of the <i>Block</i> forces the
<i>Letter</i> between the <i>Blocks</i> forwards, and so the
whole <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letters</i> between these two <i>Knots</i> are
screwzed together, and by the <i>Wedge</i> <i>e f</i> in <i>Plate
21</i> (also with the force of a <i>Mallet</i>) <i>Wedges</i> the
two <i>Blocks</i> and the <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letter</i> in them also
tight, and close between the sides of the two <i>Blocks</i>;
that afterwards the <i>Plow</i> may more certainly do its
Office upon the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Letter</i>; as shall be shewed
hereafter.1</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 3. <i>Of the</i> Dressing-Hook.</h4>

<p>The <i>Dressing-Hook</i> is described in <i>Plate 21</i> at c.
This is a long square <i>Rod</i> of <i>Iron</i>, about two Foot
long and a <i>Great-Primmer</i> square: Its end <i>a</i> is about
a <i>two-Lin’d-English</i> thick, and hath a small <i>Return</i>
piece of <i>Iron</i> made square to the under-side of the
<i>Rod</i>, that when the whole <i>Dressing-Hook</i> is laid
along a <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letter</i>, this <i>Return piece</i> or <i>Hook</i> may,
when the <i>Rod</i> is drawn with the <i>Ball</i> of the Thumb,
by the <i>Knot</i> on the upper-side of it at c, draw
all the <i>Letter</i> in the <i>Stick</i> tight and close up together,
that the <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letter</i> may be <i>Scraped</i>, as
shall be shewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 4. <i>Of the</i> Dressing-Knife.</h4>

<p>The <i>Dressing-Knife</i> is delineated at d in <i>Plate 21</i>. It
is only a short piece of a <i>Knife</i> broken off about
two Inches from the <i>Sholder</i>: But its Edge is <i>Basil’d</i>
away from the back to the point pretty suddenly to
make it the stronger: The <i>Sprig</i> or <i>Pin</i> of the <i>Handle</i>
is commonly let into an Hole drilled into a
piece of the Tip of an Harts-horn, as in the Figure
and is fastned in with <i>Rosen</i>, as other <i>Knives</i> are into
their <i>Handles</i>.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 5. <i>Of the</i> Plow.</h4>

<p>The <i>Plow</i> is delineated in <i>Plate 21</i> at e: It is almost
a common <i>Plain</i> (which I have already described
in <i>Vol.</i> 1. <i>Numb.</i> 4. <i>Plate 4</i>. and §. 2 to 9.)
only with this distinction, that through the length
of the <i>Sole</i> runs such a <i>Tongue</i>, as does through the
<i>Male-Block</i> to slide tight and yet easily through the
<i>Groove</i> made on the top of the <i>Male-block</i>: Its
<i>Blade</i> makes an <i>Angle</i> of 60 Degrees with the <i>Sole</i>
of it.</p>

<br>
<h3>§. 21. ¶. 1. <i>Of</i> Dressing <i>of</i> Letters.</h3>

<p>The <i>Letter-Dresser</i> hath (as I told you before)
his <i>Letter Set</i> up in <i>Composing-sticks</i>, with their
<i>Nicks</i> upwards, and those <i>Sticks</i> set upon the <i>Racks</i>:
Therefore he takes one <i>Stick</i> off the <i>Racks</i>, and placing
the <i>Handle</i> of the <i>Composing-stick</i> in his left hand,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>

he takes the contrary end of the <i>Dressing-stick</i> in
his right-hand, and laying the Back of the <i>Dressing-stick</i>
even upon or rather a little hanging over
the Back of the <i>Composing-stick</i>, that the <i>Feet</i> of the
<i>Letter</i> may fall within the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i> of the <i>Dressing-stick</i>;
He at the same time fits the <i>Side-Ledge</i> of
the <i>Dressing-stick</i> against the farther end of the <i>Line</i>
of <i>Letters</i> in the <i>Composing-stick</i>: And holding then
both <i>Sticks</i> together, his left hand at the <i>Handle</i>-end
of the <i>Composing-stick</i>, and his right-Hand within
about two Handfuls of the <i>Handle</i>-end of the <i>Dressing-stick</i>,
He turns his Hands, <i>Sticks</i> and all, outward
from his left hand, till the <i>Composing-stick</i> lies
flat upon the <i>Dressing-stick</i>, and consequently the
<i>Letters</i> in the <i>Composing-stick</i> is turned and laid upon
the <i>Dressing-stick</i>.</p>

<p>Then he goes as near the Light as he can with
the <i>Letters</i> in his <i>Dressing-stick</i>, and examins what
<i>Letters Come not well</i> either in the <i>Face</i> or <i>Shanck</i>:
So that then holding the <i>Dressing-stick</i> in his left hand,
and tilting the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i> a little downward,
that the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i> may rest against
the <i>Bottom-Ledge</i>, and laying the Ball of his Thumb
upon any certain Number of <i>Letters</i> between his
<i>Body</i> and the <i>Letter</i> to be <i>Cast out</i>, He with the
<i>Foot</i> of a <i>Space</i> or some thin <i>Letter</i>, lifts up the <i>Letter</i>
to be <i>Cast out</i>, and lets it fall upon the <i>Dressing-Bench</i>:
and thus he does to all the <i>Letters</i> in that <i>Stick</i>
that are to be <i>Thrown out</i>.</p>

<p>Then taking again the <i>Dressing-Stick</i> in his left hand
at or near the handle of it, he takes the <i>Dressing-Hook</i>
at the <i>Knot</i>, between the fore-Finger and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>

Thumb of his right-Hand, and laying the <i>Hook</i> over
the edge of the <i>Quadrat</i> at the farther end of the
<i>Dressing-stick</i>, near the <i>bottom-Ledge</i> of it, he slips
his right-Hand to the <i>Handle</i> of the <i>Dressing-stick</i>,
and his left hand towards the middle of the <i>Dressing-stick</i>,
so as the end of the Ball of his Thumb
may draw by the farther end of the <i>Knot</i> on the
<i>Dressing-Hook</i> the whole <i>Dressing-Hook</i>, and the <i>Hook</i>
at the end of it the whole <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letter</i> close together
towards him; While at the same time he with
his Fingers clutched about the <i>Stick</i> and <i>Letter</i>, and
the Thumb-<i>ball</i> of his hand presses the under flat of
the <i>Hooking-stick</i> close against the <i>Letter</i> and <i>Dressing-stick</i>,
that the <i>Letter</i> in the <i>Stick</i> may lie fast and manageable.</p>

<p>Then he takes the <i>Handle</i> of the <i>Dressing-Knife</i>
in his right-Hand, and inclining the back of it towards
his <i>Body</i>, that its <i>Basil</i>-edge may <i>Cut</i> or <i>Scrap</i>
the smoother, He <i>Scrapes</i> twice or thrice upon so
much of the whole <i>Line</i> of <i>Letters</i> as lies between
the outer-side of the <i>Dressing-Hook</i> and the <i>Face</i> of
the <i>Letter</i>.</p>

<p>But if twice or thrice <i>Scraping</i>, have not taken all
the <i>Bur</i> or irregularities off so much of the <i>Letter</i> as
he <i>Scraped</i> upon, he <i>Scrapes</i> yet longer and oftner
till the whole number of <i>Letters</i> in the <i>Dressing-stick</i>
from end to end seems but one intire piece of
<i>Mettal</i>.</p>

<p>Thus is that side of the fore-part (<i>viz.</i> that
part towards the <i>Face</i>) of the <i>Shanck</i> of the <i>Body</i>
finisht.</p>

<p>To <i>Scrape</i> the other end of that side of the <i>Letter</i>,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>

<i>viz.</i> that towards the <i>Feet</i>; He turns the <i>Handle</i>
of the <i>Stick</i> from him, and removing the <i>Dressing-Hook</i>
towards the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> which is
already <i>Scraped</i>, he places his Thumb against the
<i>Knot</i> of the <i>Dressing-Hook</i>, and presses it hard from
him, that the <i>Hook</i> of the <i>Dressing-Hook</i> being now
towards him, may force the whole <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letter</i> forwards
against the <i>Side-Ledge</i> of the <i>Dressing-stick</i>; that
so the whole <i>Line</i> in the <i>Stick</i> may lie again the faster
and more manageable: Then he <i>Scrapes</i> with the <i>Dressing-Knife</i>
as before, till the end of the <i>Shanck</i> of the
<i>Letter</i> towards the <i>Feet</i> be also <i>Drest</i>.</p>

<p>Then he lays by his <i>Dressing-Hook</i>, and keeping
his <i>Dressing-stick</i> of <i>Letter</i> still in his left hand,
he takes a second <i>Dressing-stick</i>, with its <i>Handle</i> in
his right-Hand, and lays the <i>Side-Ledge</i> of it against
the hither-side of the <i>Quadrat</i> at the hither end of
the <i>Dressing-stick</i>, and the <i>bottom-Ledge</i> of the second
<i>Stick</i> hanging a little over the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, that
they may be comprehended within the <i>bottom-Ledge</i>
of the second <i>Dressing-stick</i>; and so removing his left hand
towards the middle of both <i>Dressing-sticks</i>, and
clasping them close together, he turns both Hands
outwards towards the left, till the <i>Letter</i> in the first
<i>Dressing-stick</i> lie upon the second <i>Dressing-stick</i>, and
then the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> will lie outwards toward
the right-Hand, and the <i>Nicks</i> upwards. Then he
uses the <i>Dressing-Hook</i> and <i>Dressing-Knife</i> to <i>Scrape</i>
this side the <i>Line</i> of <i>Letter</i>, as he did before to the other
side of the <i>Line</i> of <i>Letter</i>: So shall both sides be <i>Scraped</i>
and <i>Drest</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus <i>Scraped</i> both the sides, He takes the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>

<i>Handle</i> of the <i>Dressing-stick</i> into his left hand, as before,
and takes the <i>Male-block</i> into his right-Hand,
and placing the <i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Block</i> against the <i>Face</i>
of the <i>Letter</i> in the <i>Dressing-stick</i>, he also places the
<i>Knot</i> of the <i>Block</i> against the farther side of the
<i>Quadrat</i> at the farther end of the <i>Stick</i>, and so placing
his right-Hand underneath the middle of the
<i>Dressing-stick</i> and <i>Block</i>, he turns his Hand outwards
towards the left, as before, and transfers the
<i>Letter</i> in the <i>Dressing-stick</i> to the <i>Male-Block</i>: Yet he
so holds and manages the <i>Block</i> that the <i>Shanck</i> of
the <i>Letter</i> may rest at once upon the side of the <i>Block</i>
the <i>Knot</i> is placed in, and the <i>Face</i> of the <i>Letter</i> upon
the <i>Tongue</i>.</p>

<p>When his <i>Stick</i> of <i>Letters</i> is thus transfer’d to the
<i>Male-Block</i>, He claps the middle of the <i>Male-Block</i>
into his left hand, tilting the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i> a little
upwards, that the <i>Face</i> may rest upon the <i>Tongue</i>,
and then takes about the middle of the <i>Female-Block</i>
in his right-Hand, and lays it so upon the <i>Male-Block</i>,
that the <i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Male-Block</i> may fall into the
<i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Female-Block</i>, and that the <i>Knot</i> at
the hither end of the <i>Female Block</i> may stand against
the hither-side of the <i>Quadrat</i> at the hither end of
the <i>Line</i> of <i>Letters</i>: So that when the <i>Knot</i> of the
<i>Male-Block</i> is lightly drawn towards the <i>Knot</i> of the
<i>Female-Block</i>, or the <i>Knot</i> of the <i>Female-Block</i>
lightly thrust towards the <i>Knot</i> of the <i>Male-Block</i>,
both <i>Knots</i> shall squeeze the <i>Letter</i> close between
them.</p>

<p>Then he grasps both <i>Blocks</i> with the <i>Letter</i> between
them in both his Hands, and lays them in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>

the <i>Block-Groove</i>, with the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i> upwards,
and the hither-side of the hither <i>Block</i> against the
hither <i>Cheek</i> of the <i>Block-Groove</i>. And putting the
<i>Wedge</i> into the vacant space between the <i>Blocks</i> and
the further <i>Cheek</i> of the <i>Block-Groove</i>, he lightly
with his right-Hand thrusts up the <i>Wedge</i> to force the
<i>Blocks</i> close together, and pinch the <i>Letter</i> close between
the <i>Blocks</i>.</p>

<p>Then with the <i>Balls</i> of the Fingers of both his
Hands, he Patts gently upon the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i>,
to press all their <i>Faces</i> down upon the <i>Tongue</i>; which
having done, he takes the <i>Mallet</i> in his right-Hand,
and with it knocks gently upon the head of the
<i>Wedge</i> to pinch the <i>Letter</i> yet closer to the insides
of the <i>Blocks</i>. Then he Knocks lightly and successively
upon the <i>Knot-ends</i> of both the <i>Blocks</i>, to force
the <i>Letters</i> yet closer together. And then again
knocks now pretty hard upon the head of the
<i>Wedge</i>, and also pretty hard upon the <i>Knot-ends</i>
of the <i>Blocks</i>, to <i>Lock</i> the <i>Letter</i> tight and close
up.</p>

<p>Then he places the <i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Plow</i> in the upper
<i>Groove</i> of the <i>Block</i>; And having the <i>Tooth</i> of the <i>Iron</i> fitted
in the <i>Plow</i>, so as to fall just upon the middle of
the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, he grasps the <i>Plow</i> in his right-Hand,
placing his Wrist-Ball against the <i>Britch</i> of it,
and guiding the fore-end with his left hand, slides the
<i>Plow</i> gently along the whole length of the <i>Blocks</i>;
so as the <i>Tooth</i> of the <i>Iron</i> bears upon the <i>Feet</i> of
the <i>Letter</i>: And if it be a small <i>Letter</i> he <i>Plows</i> upon,
the <i>Tooth</i> of the <i>Iron</i> will have cut a <i>Groove</i> deep enough
through the length of the whole <i>Block</i> of <i>Letters</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>But if the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Letter</i> be great, he reiterates
his <i>Traverses</i> two three or four times according
to the Bigness of the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, till
he have made a <i>Groove</i> about a <i>Space</i> deep in the <i>Feet</i>
of the <i>Shancks</i> of the whole <i>Blocks</i> of <i>Letter</i>, and
have cut off all the irregularities of the <i>Break</i>.</p>

<p>Then with a small piece of <i>Buff</i> or some other soft
<i>Leather</i>, he rubs a little upon the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i> to
smoothen them.</p>

<p>Then he unlocks the <i>Blocks</i> of <i>Letter</i>, by knocking
with the <i>Mallet</i> upon the small end of the <i>Wedge</i>,
and first takes the <i>Wedge</i> from between the <i>Blocks</i> and
<i>Cheeks</i>, and lays it upon the farther <i>Cheek</i>, and afterwards
takes the <i>Blocks</i> with <i>Letter</i> in it near both ends
of the <i>Blocks</i> between the Fingers and Thumbs of
both his Hands, and turns the hithermost <i>Block</i> upon
the hithermost <i>Cheek</i>, and with his Fingers and
Thumbs again lifts off the upper <i>Block</i>, leaving the <i>Letter</i>
on the undermost <i>Block</i> with its <i>Face</i> against the
<i>Tongue</i>.</p>

<p>Then taking the <i>Block</i> with <i>Letter</i> in it in his left hand,
he places the <i>Knot-end</i> from him, and takes
the <i>Handle</i> of the <i>Dressing-stick</i> in his right-Hand, and
lays the <i>Side-Ledge</i> of it against the hither-side of the
<i>Quadrat</i> at the hither end, and the <i>Bottom-ledge</i> against
the <i>Feet</i> of the <i>Letter</i>, he grasps the <i>Handle</i> of
the <i>Dressing-stick Block</i> and all in his left hand, and
lays his right-Hand Thumb along the under-side of
the <i>Dressing-stick</i> about the middle, and with the
Fingers of the same Hand grasps the <i>Block</i>, and
turning his Hands, <i>Block</i>, and <i>Dressing-stick</i> to the
right, transfers the <i>Letter</i> in the <i>Block</i> upon the <i>Dressing-stick</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span></p>  

<p>Then grasping the <i>Dressing-stick</i> by the <i>Handle</i>
with his left hand, he with his right-Hand takes the
<i>Dressing-Hook</i> by the <i>Knot</i>, and lays the inside of
the <i>Hook</i> of it against the farther side of the <i>Quadrat</i>
at the farther end of the <i>Stick</i>, and drawing the <i>Hook</i>
and <i>Letter</i> in the <i>Dressing-stick</i> with his left Thumb
by the <i>Knot</i> close up toward him, he resting the
<i>Stick</i> upon the <i>Dressing-bench</i> that he may <i>Scrape</i> the
harder upon the <i>Beard</i> with the Edge of the <i>Dressing-Knife</i>,
<i>Scrapes</i> off the <i>Beard</i> as near the <i>Face</i> as
he dares for fear of spoiling it, and about a Thick
<i>Space</i> deep at least into the <i>Shanck</i>.</p>

<p>If the Bottom and Top are both to be <i>Bearded</i>,
He transfers the <i>Letter</i> into another <i>Dressing-stick</i>,
as hath been shewed, and <i>Beards</i> it also as before.</p>

<br>
<h4>¶. 2. <i>Some Rules and Circumstances to be observed in</i>
Dressing <i>of</i> Letters.</h4>

<p>1. The <i>Letter-Dresser</i> ought to be furnisht with
three or four sorts of <i>Dressing-sticks</i>, which differ nothing
from one another save in the Height of their
<i>Ledges</i>. The <i>Ledges</i> of one pair no higher than a
<i>Scaboard</i>. This pair of <i>Sticks</i> may serve to <i>Dress</i>,
<i>Pearl</i>, <i>Nomparel</i>, and <i>Brevier</i>. Another pair whose
<i>Ledges</i> may be a <i>Nomparel</i> high. And this pair of
<i>Dressing-sticks</i> will serve to <i>Dress</i> <i>Brevier</i>, <i>Long-Primmer</i>,
and <i>Pica</i>: Another pair whose <i>Ledges</i> may be
a <i>Long-Primmer</i> high: And these <i>Dressing-sticks</i> may
serve to <i>Dress</i> <i>Pica</i>, <i>English</i>, <i>Great-Primmer</i>, and
<i>Double-Pica</i>. And if you will another pair of <i>DresDressing-sticks</i>,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>

whose <i>Ledges</i> may be an <i>English</i>
High: And these <i>Dressing-sticks</i> may serve to
<i>Dress</i> all big Bodyed <i>Letters</i>, even to the Greatest.</p>

<p>2. As he ought to be furnisht with several sorts of
<i>Dressing-sticks</i> as aforesaid: So ought he also to be
furnisht with several <i>Blocks</i>, whose <i>Knots</i> are to correspond
with the Sizes of the <i>Ledges</i> of the <i>Dressing-sticks</i>,
for the <i>Dressing</i> of several <i>Bodies</i> as aforesaid.</p>

<p>3. He ought to be furnisht with three or four <i>Dressing-Hooks</i>,
whose <i>Hooks</i> ought to be of the several
Depths aforesaid, to fit and suit with the several <i>Bodyed-Letters</i>.</p>

<p>4. He must have two <i>Dressing-Knives</i>, one to lie
before the <i>Blocks</i> to <i>Scrape</i> and <i>Beard</i> the <i>Letter</i> in the
<i>Sticks</i>, and the other behind the <i>Dressing-blocks</i> to
use when occasion serves to <i>Scrape</i> off a small <i>Bur</i>, the
<i>Tooth</i> of the <i>Plow</i> may have left upon the <i>Feet</i> of the
<i>Letter</i>. And though one <i>Dressing-Knife</i> may serve
to both these uses: Yet when Work-men are in a Train
of Work they begrutch the very turning the Body
about, or stepping one step forward or backward;
accounting that it puts them out of their Train, and
hinders their riddance of Work.</p>

<p>5. For every <i>Body</i> of <i>Letter</i> he is to have a particular
<i>Plow</i>, and the <i>Tooth</i> of the <i>Iron</i> of each <i>Plow</i>
is to be made exactly to a set bigness, the measure of
which bigness is to be taken from the size of the <i>Break</i>
that is to be <i>Plowed</i> away. For Example, If it be
a <i>Pearl Body</i> to be <i>Plowed</i>, the breadth of the <i>Tooth</i>
ought not to be above a thin <i>Scaboard</i>: Because the
<i>Break</i> of that <i>Body</i> cannot be bigger, for Reasons I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>

have given before; But the <i>Tooth</i> must be full broad
enough, and rather broader than the <i>Break</i>, lest any
of the irregularity of the <i>Break</i> should be left upon
the <i>Foot</i> of the <i>Letter</i>. And so for every <i>Body</i> he
fits the <i>Tooth</i> of the <i>Iron</i>, full broad enough and a
little broader than the size of the <i>Break</i>. This is one
reason why for every particular <i>Body</i> he ought to
have a particular <i>Plow</i>. Another reason is.</p>

<p>The <i>Tooth</i> of this <i>Plow</i> must be exactly set to a punctual
distance from the <i>Tongue</i> of the <i>Plow</i>: For if
they should often shift <i>Irons</i> to the several <i>Stocks</i> of
the <i>Plow</i>, they would create themselves by shifting
more trouble than the price of a <i>Stock</i> would compensate.</p>

<p>A <i>Fount</i> of <i>Letter</i> being new <i>Cast</i> and <i>Drest</i>, the
Boy <i>Papers</i> up each sort in a <i>Cartridge</i> by it self, and
puts about an hundred Pounds weight, <i>viz.</i> a Porters
Burthen into a <i>Basket</i> to be sent to the <i>Master-Printers</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Steel-Punches</i> being now <i>Cut</i>, the <i>Molds</i> made,
the <i>Matrices Sunk</i>, the <i>Letters Cast</i>, and <i>Drest</i>, the
application of these <i>Letters</i> falls now to the task of the
<i>Compositer</i>; whose <i>Trade</i> shall be (God willing) the
Subject of the next <i>Exercises</i>.</p>
